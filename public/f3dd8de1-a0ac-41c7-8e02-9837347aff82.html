Despite securing another runner-up spot in the top-flight, Arteta's squad fell notably short of champions Liverpool.<br><br>However, there remains a sense of optimism at the Emirates Stadium that the summer transfer window could bring in the right players to end Arsenal's league title drought. One such new addition is Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi. The Basque club were unable to retain their midfielder due to a €60million (£51m) release clause in his contract.<br><br>Brentford captain Christian Norgaard is another fresh face, joining for £15m, as is goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. Below are some of the latest Arsenal headlines along with an insight into each one.<br><br>Reports from German publication Bild claim that Arsenal have expressed a strong interest in Bayern Munich's Joao Palhinha and there was ‘almost a major transfer’ before Bayern got their Club World Cup campaign up and running.<br><br>It is claimed that Palhinha is high up on Arsenal’s shortlist of midfield targets. The report claims that ‘concrete figures’ have been discussed to lure the ex-Fulham man back to Premier League football.<br><br>But at this stage, it is said that Arsenal are yet to come close to reaching an agreement for Palhinha and the Gunners have been forced to explore other avenues to bolster Mikel Arteta’s options in the middle of the park.<br><br>Isaac Seelochan of football.london says: "I'm not sure why Arsenal would sign Palhinha. They have already signed Zubimendi and Norgaard, who can play in a similar position, while Mikel Merino is also another option in Arteta's squad. The money would be better spent elsewhere, and I imagine Viktor Gyokeres will take up a large chunk of their remaining funds for this summer."<br><br>Arsenal are reportedly pleased with their prospective deal for Chelsea forward Noni Madueke - despite backlash among some fans.<br><br>“I know Arsenal are very happy with the price they have paid," journalist Charles Watt told Caught Offside.<br><br>“They believe it matches up well to what other players of Madueke’s profile have moved for this summer, and are adamant that in a couple of years time people will look on it as an excellent piece of business.<br><br>“Arteta has really been pushing this deal, he believes Madueke can thrive in an environment like Arsenal’s and does not view him as a back-up. He is bringing him in to play a lot of games, whether that be on the right or on the left.”<br><br>Isaac Seelochan of football.london says: "Fans have every right to voice their opinions on a new signing as long as they don't cross the line. In my view, Madueke is a talented player who will improve Arsenal's attack."<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
