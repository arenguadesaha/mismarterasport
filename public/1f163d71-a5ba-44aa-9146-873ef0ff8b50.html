With a number of tributes planned by both clubs ahead of kick-off, supporters had been asked to be in their seats by 2.45pm.<br><br>But the travelling Reds filled the Bill Shankly Kop at Deepdale long before. And 10 minutes before the pre-planned tributes were officially set to get underway, they made sure to kick things off themselves with a rendition of the Portuguese’s chant.<br><br>“He’s a lad from Portugal, better than Figo, don’t you know? Oh, his name is Diogo!”<br><br>Jota’s chant was always going to be ringing in ears at Deepdale. That rendition might have been the first from the entire stand, but it was not the last.<br><br>Singing on loop, Liverpool’s travelling support started chanting in honour of Jota again before the official tributes at 2.50pm.<br><br>Claudia Rose Maguire – wife of former Preston player Sean - kicked things off with a rendition of Can’t Help Falling In Love, briefly stopping the Jota chants in the process.<br><br>The Liverpool supporters would join in with the line itself, ‘can’t help falling in love with you,’ as the emotions took hold at Deepdale.<br><br>The Jota chants then briefly resumed before Maguire started singing a hugely emotional rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone.<br><br>Supporters were left shedding tears during the club’s anthem as an emotional Preston captain Ben Whiteman then walked out with a wreath in honour of Jota, and his brother, Andre Silva, walked the length of the Deepdale pitch to lay it in front of the away supporters.<br><br>The sight of that alone was greeted with thunderous applause, never mind the completion of the gesture as Whiteman bowed his head to the wreath before rejoining his team-mates at the other end coming out the Deepdale tunnel.<br><br>Further applause followed once Maguire had finished the song, before Jota’s chant again took over as the players walked out.<br><br>With both sides then taking part in a minute’s silence, Liverpool players couldn't hide their emotions, along with head coach Arne Slot, as the Reds and Preston paid tribute to the Portuguese brothers.<br><br>The ECHO was in attendance at Deepdale on what was always going to be a highly emotional occasion. And it's fair to say there were goosebumps during the aforementioned tributes as the Reds were joined by the Lilywhites in honouring one of their own.<br><br>There were dozens of banners in the away end in honour of the Portuguese, while Jota’s chant would continue to be sung.<br><br>Forever Liverpool’s number 20, after the Reds announced their decision to retire his shirt number on Friday, he will never be forgotten.<br><br>This was a fitting and moving first public way to honour Jota and Silva. But it will not be the last.</div></body></html>
