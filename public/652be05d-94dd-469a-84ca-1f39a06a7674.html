Both parties are happy with the €73.5million (£63.7million) fee, of which €10million (£8.4million) are add-ons, but they are still discussing the latter.<br><br>Sporting president Frederico Varandas made it clear that a €70million (£60million) package would not be enough to sign Gyokeres and therefore considering they have accepted just a little more than that, it is perhaps no surprise they are haggling over the bonuses.<br><br>While exactly what they are discussing is not known, it seems likely that Sporting want virtually guaranteed funds from the add-ons and Arsenal are keen for them to be based around winning trophies.<br><br>With no breakthrough arriving since that agreement in principle was reached last weekend, it is hard to imagine that Gyokeres will travel to Singapore alongside the rest of the Arsenal squad on Saturday, July 19. Noni Madueke and Cristhian Mosquera look likely to be two players on that plane though, with confirmation of their arrivals imminent.<br><br>Arteta's focus will definitely switch onto upcoming friendlies with a clash against Newcastle United scheduled for next Sunday. Berta meanwhile, may still be locked in talks with the Portuguese champions in the hope that Gyokeres can eventually join his new teammates in Asia.<br><br>However, there appears to be some fear setting in that that may not happen with it looking as though a back-up plan has been hatched by Arsenal in case the Gyokeres deal collapses.<br><br>According to Italian journalist Orazio Accomando, Arsenal could make a move for Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson or Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa as they strive for progress in a deal for Gyokeres. Manchester United have been linked to both players with the Gunners' interest in Watkins well-documented.<br><br>As for Jackson, his position at Stamford Bridge now appears under serious threat following the arrivals of Liam Delap and Joao Pedro with both preferred by Enzo Maresca to Jackson in the Blues' stunning Club World Cup final victory over Paris Saint-Germain.<br><br>Returning for Benjamin Sesko seems off the table with RB Leipzig unlikely to reduce their lofty asking price. Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak have been linked but the latter looks set to stay at Newcastle while Liverpool bring in the Eintracht Frankfurt striker.</div></body></html>
