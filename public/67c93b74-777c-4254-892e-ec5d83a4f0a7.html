The Swedish superstar, Liverpool's dream striker target, is at the centre of a tense tug-of-war between the Reds and Newcastle.<br><br>This week, Liverpool floated the idea of a British transfer record £120million bid for Isak, but Newcastle are refusing to do business. As a result, Liverpool have turned their attention to Hugo Ekitike, hijacking Newcastle's pursuit of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward, with a £70m deal taking shape.<br><br>Liverpool haven't given up on Isak and could push for the 25-year-old again next year, or possibly even later in the window. But as things stand, he looks set to stay at St James' Park.<br><br>This isn't the first time Isak has been at the centre of a transfer battle. Back in 2017, he joined Borussia Dortmund from Swedish club AIK under a cloud of controversy.<br><br>For some time, it looked as if the forward, who was just 17 at the time, was going to sign for Real Madrid. But to their dismay, Dortmund swooped in at the last minute to nab the attacking prodigy in a £8.6m deal, much to the bemusement and frustration of then-manager Thomas Tuchel.<br><br>Despite getting his hands on one of the world's most highly-rated teenagers, Tuchel was angered that Dortmund chiefs hadn't consulted him about the transfer, sparking tension that would ultimately end with the German quitting the club a few months later.<br><br>When asked about Isak in a press conference shortly before the transfer was completed, Tuchel bluntly snapped: "Talk to [Dortmund sporting director] Michael Zorc [about it]."<br><br>Isak made just one senior appearance under Tuchel, coming on as a substitute during Dortmund's 3-0 German Cup win over third-tier side Sportfreunde Lotte. Things barely improved the following season, with Isak scoring just once in 12 appearances, only three of which were starts. But in 2018/19, Isak's career took off.<br><br>He was loaned to Eredivisie club Willem II and blasted 14 goals in 18 games. His sparkling form caught the attention of Real Sociedad, who snapped him up for a mere £7.5m fee ahead of the 2019/20 campaign.<br><br>In Spain, Isak came alive, netting 16 goals and 17 goals respectively in his first two seasons. His tally dropped to 10 goals in 2021/22, but that didn't stop Newcastle shelling out a club-record £63m to bring him to the Toon.<br><br>In the three years since, Isak has scored 62 goals in 109 games for Newcastle and bagged a career-best 27-goal haul in 2024/25. As such, he's now one of the most sought-after strikers in the world, with Liverpool one of several top-tier clubs salivating at the prospect of signing him.<br><br>Isak has three years remaining on his Newcastle contract, giving the Magpies plenty of leverage over potential suitors. Liverpool will likely need to break the bank to land Isak, with some reports suggesting Newcastle will ask for around £150m if and when they decide to sell the Sweden international.<br><br>As things stand, Isak will not push for an exit this summer. However, it's understood he's 'unhappy' about his contract situation. Talks over a new deal are at a standstill, with Isak looking for a significant bump in his £130,000-a-week salary.<br><br>For now, Liverpool are standing by, waiting to pounce if things between Newcastle and Isak go awry. But with the Magpies refusing to entertain offers for the player, and with Liverpool closing in on Ekitike, the saga looks set to be put on hold.</div></body></html>
