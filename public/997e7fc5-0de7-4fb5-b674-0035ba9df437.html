          <h1>Arsenal could get Eberechi Eze transfer green light after £58m bid amid Mikel Arteta dilemma</h1>
          <div>Arsenal could see a transfer domino involving Liverpool help them sign Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace. Sporting director Andrea Berta held talks with his representatives in June with interest remaining despite the Gunners sanctioning a deal for Noni Madueke.<br><br>In addition to the £70million or so being spent to sign Kepa Arrizabalaga, Christian Norgaard and Martin Zubimendi, at least £48.5million will be heading to Chelsea for Madueke. Arsenal are also working on deals for Cristian Mosquera and Viktor Gyokeres with a combined £68million committed upfront.<br><br>That does not leave much room in the budget for another big signing such as Eze or Real Madrid's Rodrygo, but a significant sale could change that. The likes of Oleksandr Zinchenko, Reiss Nelson and Fabio Vieira are expected to depart permanently, but it seems unlikely enough could be raised from those three names departing.<br><br>Given their first-team involvement last season, more could be demanded for centre-back Jakub Kiwior and versatile forward Leandro Trossard, but it may have to be Arsenal's other left winger in Gabriel Martinelli that departs.<br><br>Bayern Munich and Saudi Pro League clubs have been linked but there is currently no active discussions for the Brazil international. That could change very soon however, as the German giants have seen their opening bid for Luis Diaz rejected immediately by Liverpool, as per football.london's sister title The Echo.<br><br>With the Premier League champions wanting in the region of £100million to sell, Vincent Kompany and Co. may have to start seriously considering alternatives. The departure of Leroy Sane and serious injury suffered by Jamal Musiala likely means that signing a new attacker should be essential.<br><br>If they cannot reach a compromise for Diaz, Martinelli could soon become the priority target. Arteta would then face up to three big decisions with the first of those centring around whether or not he would be willing to let Martinelli go.<br><br>Allowing his departure would see a significant amount of funds come into the club and Arsenal would then have more than enough, assuming other exits take place, to sign Eze. However, even with the latter in, that leaves Trossard as the only natural left winger at the club.<br><br>Though the club believe Madueke can be deployed on both flanks, he is far better on the right and that could therefore see another wide forward targeted.<br><br>Rodrygo has been linked for the last few months and is expected to depart the Spanish capital while the chance to sign Anthony Gordon from Newcastle could emerge if they keep Alexander Isak and also sign Hugo Ekitike amid interest in both from Liverpool.<br><br>This scenario requires a lot of factors falling Arsenal's way but selling Martinelli to Bayern will make it much easier to pay Eze's £68million release clause with his versatility and Premier League knowhow making him a better buy than Rodrygo.<br><br>However, Arteta could still decide to try and sign them both with a big sale helping concerns over potentially breaking profit and sustainability rules.</div>
