The Reds have splashed out almost £200million on new recruits this summer and are closing on another with talks continuing with Eintracht Frankfurt over £80m-rated striker Hugo Ekitike.<br><br>Germany international attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz has been been signed in a club record £116m deal while Bayer Leverkusen team-mate and Holland right-back Jeremie Frimpong has moved for almost £30m.<br><br>Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez has arrived for £40m, and Liverpool have also swooped for reserve goalkeepers Armin Pecsi from Puskas Akademia and Freddie Woodman on a free transfer.<br><br>With six weeks remaining in the window, the Premier League is on course for a record collective outlay in the transfer market.<br><br>And former Liverpool striker Emile Heskey believes his old club have stolen a march on their rivals as they look to defend the championship they won convincingly last season.<br><br>"I think the best window so far is Liverpool’s," he said. "They got Florian Wirtz, who I think adds an edge to their midfield, and I think Jeremie Frimpong is such a versatile player on the right flank.<br><br>"As well as that, you’ve got Milos Kerkez, and they could be getting more players in before the transfer window is closed.<br><br>"To get Wirtz when everyone else was linked to him, that’s a huge statement. To get it done early, too, could be important.<br><br>"They’re like United used to be. They find what they want, they go into the transfer market and get it done. It’s pinpoint.<br><br>"I can remember when United found Van Nistelrooy and went straight for him. Now Liverpool are that team."<br><br>Speaking to BestBettingSites.co.uk, Heskey has dismissed suggestions Lionel Messi could make a loan move to Anfield in preparation for next summer's World Cup.<br><br>"I’m sure all of the Premier League sides will be interested in taking Lionel Messi on loan from Inter Miami," he said.<br><br>"The explosion in shirt sales and marketing would be incredible. We never saw Inter Miami shirts outside of Miami before he arrived, now they’re everywhere. He has a crazy impact.<br><br>"In terms of football, the only ones who could accommodate him are the top four, but none of them will play a style that will allow him to take it easy throughout a game. He doesn’t have that intensity anymore.<br><br>"If he wants to go back then probably France would suit him, because I think Italy is too intense. But I think Spain, and Barcelona, is the natural fit. He can’t go anywhere else, can he?"</div></body></html>
