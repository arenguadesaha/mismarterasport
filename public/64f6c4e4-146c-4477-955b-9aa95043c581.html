It is said that the call was made to end the talks after Reds boss Ruben Amorim expressed his dissatisfaction.<br><br>The report claimed that United executives had been in talks with Amazon for several months, with the idea of producing a documentary on what is set to be a hugely important season for United after their worst in the Premier League era. The money on offer was set to be ‘significantly more’ than £10million, the most money that any team had ever received for an ‘All or Nothing’ series.<br><br>Similar shows have been made involving Manchester City and Newcastle United on the streaming platform.<br><br>And football finance expert Dan Plumley has expressed his belief that a behind-the-scenes documentary at Old Trafford will still happen one day.<br><br>“With this one, there’s a couple of factors in play," he told Football Insider. "I think it’s likely we’ll see this documentary at some point in the future.<br><br>“Manchester United will continue to hold that appeal around the world of a club that people want to know what’s going on and want to get behind the scenes. I think this will happen at some point.<br><br>"I think the timing, as you say, there’s some logic in the fact that it might not be the right time, it probably would make good TV for sure, but it might not be the right time to run a documentary like this.<br><br>“In terms of the finances of it, if it is significantly more than some of the other deals we’ve seen. That speaks to the allure of Manchester United as a football club, and their revenue is actually in the top five in the world still. We have to remember that, despite all their on-pitch problems.<br><br>“So if it is £10m or a little bit more than £10m, it’s not like they desperately need the cash. I think the bigger focus is on the exposure side of things. You can imagine the commercial spinoffs from it and what it might bring down the line.<br><br>"So I think it’s not desperation in terms of the money at this point and I do think it’s likely at some point again this will happen.”<br><br>Plumley also believes that a major part of the appeal of doing a documentary would be to connect with fans overseas.<br><br>He added: “It’s also not just about your UK home fans. These documentaries are actually more for overseas markets and international fans around the world that will consume this stuff, and they can’t get to the stadium every week.<br><br>"They can’t come and watch the team, so there’s a bigger international audience for this as well to consider.”<br><br>Our team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new free WhatsApp community.
