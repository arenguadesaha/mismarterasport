He joined us in 2016.<br><br>Manchester City have been very busy already in the summer transfer market, despite there being just under seven weeks still remaining.<br><br>As Pep Guardiola plots to make the Cityzens competitive in the Champions League, as well as the Premier League title race, again, they have acted quickly to strengthen their squad.<br><br>There are still a number of issues to address, though, and with that in mind Manchester Evening News have offered their verdict on City's transfer window so far.<br><br>City stole a march on their rivals by moving early to secure four signings before they jetted off to the USA to compete in the Club World Cup last month.<br><br>New sporting director Hugo Viana wrapped up a £31million deal for Wolves left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri, a £34million deal for Lyon playmaker Rayan Cherki and a £46.5million deal for AC Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders.<br><br>Marcus Bettinelli was also signed on a free transfer from Chelsea to become the club's new third choice goalkeeper following the departure of Scott Carson.<br><br>It meant City strengthened their squad significantly and they have addressed the majority of their blind spots in the squad before they return for pre-season training later this month.<br><br>It means Guardiola shouldn't face too much upheaval to the squad he has in mind for the upcoming 2025/26 season and that can only be a good thing for City's prospects.<br><br>City were glad to resolve the future of Kyle Walker quickly as his move to Burnley was confirmed earlier this month. The England international was deemed surplus to requirements after returning from a loan spell at AC Milan.<br><br>Guardiola has been open about his desire to trim the current City squad. That means the likes of Jack Grealish, Kalvin Phillips and James McAtee can leave the club this summer and there are decisions to make on other players.<br><br>Ilkay Gundogan and January signing Nico Gonzalez are attracting interest, while the likes of John Stones, Oscar Bobb, Vitor Reis, Matheus Nunes and others could be considered for moves - whether they are on loan or a permanent sale - if the deal is right for City.<br><br>It could be a busy summer still, particularly in terms of outgoings, and Guardiola will want to see solutions quickly.<br><br>City have got the majority of their business done but it remains to be seen whether they will re-enter the transfer market for further incomings.<br><br>18-year-old Norwegian midfielder Sverre Nypan is expected to join from Rosenborg and he will be immediately loaned out elsewhere.<br><br>City are also known to be in the market for a new right-back with Tino Livramento thought to be their ideal target. Newcastle won't want to sell and it would be an expensive deal to broker this summer.<br><br>It is perhaps a deal they will revisit next summer but they will watch on with interest as to how Newcastle deal with Liverpool interest in their star forward Alexander Isak in the coming days and weeks.<br><br>Whether they go for an alternative right-back is the big question. Flamengo right-back Wesley has also been linked with a move to the Etihad Stadium.<br><br>If City choose not to sign a recognised right-back and go with Nunes, Rico Lewis and possibly Abdukodir Khusanov as makeshift options, it would be a big gamble.<br><br>It is a decision that could potentially make or break their season.</div></body></html>
