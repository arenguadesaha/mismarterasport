Initial reports had suggested a fee in the region of £300,000, though it's believed Liverpool’s offer was short of that valuation.<br><br>That development has opened the door for the Gunners, who have reportedly entered the fray with a stronger offer. Arsenal are said to have one of the top youth academies in England, and Wright's prolific record makes him an intriguing addition.<br><br>Arsenal aren’t alone in their interest. Brentford, Leicester City and Burnley have all kept tabs on the teenager, while Manchester City were also previously linked.<br><br>But with Liverpool out of the picture, the path now looks clearer for the north London club to secure a deal.<br><br>Wright is in the second year of his scholarship with Salford, having been scouted from non-league football just two years ago after standout spells with Euxton Villa and Fylde. He’s since flourished, scoring over 50 goals across youth levels last season.<br><br>The 6ft 3in striker has already made four senior appearances for Salford and was named in Karl Robinson’s matchday squad 11 times last campaign. He’s also impressed this pre-season, netting three goals, including a brace against FC United.<br><br>“I feel great, I’m ready," Wright said following his first team chances. "For all of us, it’s a fantastic opportunity. Just to be even playing games, let alone training with the first team.<br><br>"Getting the opportunity and gaining the experience and taking things back to the B team and academy where we can influence them and hopefully bring more and more up, hopefully bring more people through and get more debuts."<br><br>Arsenal’s academy has a strong track record of nurturing young talent, with the likes of Bukayo Saka, Cesc Fabregas and Ashley Cole all having come through the ranks. Wright’s combination of size, composure and eye for goal could make him one to watch at Hale End.<br><br>Despite youth recruitment being a vital component of any football club, Arteta's focus at the moment will be on Viktor Gyokeres. The Swedish striker has reportedly been given the green light to travel to London, and a medical is set for this weekend.<br><br>The transfer fee is said to be worth £63.5m with around £8.65m in add-ons.
