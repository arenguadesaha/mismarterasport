Delap is an out-and-out No.9 while Joao Pedro is a versatile forward who has been used as the central striker in his three appearances for the Blues since signing from Brighton.<br><br>Both of the new signings' starts have been extremely promising. Particularly Joao Pedro's, with the Brazil international scoring three times in as many appearances in the recently-concluded FIFA Club World Cup. Meanwhile, Jackson's involvement in the competition, that Chelsea ended up winning, decreased as the tournament progressed in the United States.<br><br>Jackson started the first match against Los Angeles FC, where he produced an assist in Atlanta, but was dropped to the bench for the clash with Flamengo in Philadelphia. After coming on in the second-half, Jackson was shown a straight red card for a horror challenge just four minutes into his cameo. It was his second sending off in five games.<br><br>Chelsea are FIFA Club World Cup champions. To celebrate, the club has launched a new collection with t-shirts, hoodies and more, including the 2025/26 Home Shirt with 'World Champions 25' printing.<br><br>Such discipline problems have seen Jackson fall down the pecking order under head coach Enzo Maresca and that has fuelled speculation over the striker's future. While Chelsea are not actively looking to offload the former Villarreal centre-forward this summer, the club certainly do not view him as untouchable either and would not stand in his way should they receive an offer they deem appropriate for his services.<br><br>Aston Villa are the latest club to show an interest in Jackson, football.london understands, while Manchester United have also enquired about the striker. Unai Emery worked with Jackson during their days at Villarreal and the striker has in the past been very complimentary of the Spaniard and how he helped shape his career.<br><br>Chelsea have a keen interest in Villa attacker Morgan Rogers, although a swap deal is not on the cards, football.london has been told. That does not rule out a move for Rogers, though, with the a separate deal much more beneficial on the Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR) front. However, Villa are said to value the 22-year-old at around £80million - a price Chelsea are not willing to do business at.<br><br>While Chelsea would like Jackson to remain at Stamford Bridge and fight for his place up against likes of Joao Pedro and Delap, the Blues would not be completely against selling the striker. Jackson scored 13 goals for Chelsea in 37 appearances in all competitions across the course of the 2024/25 season.</div></body></html>
