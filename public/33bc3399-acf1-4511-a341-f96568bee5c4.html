Trump was then tasked with handing the Club World Cup trophy to Chelsea captain Reece James.<br><br>However, as James prepared to lift the trophy, Trump remained by the Chelsea captain's side, which caused a moment of confusion. Despite Infantino seemingly instructing Trump to step aside so that Chelsea could savour their victory, the US president appeared to ignore this advice and instead chose to remain at the centre of the celebrations, reports the Mirror.<br><br>Trump and Infantino eventually moved to the background after the Chelsea players moved forward for their celebrations during the trophy lift. James was joined by Chelsea teammates Enzo Fernandez and Robert Sanchez in appearing to be amused by the situation.<br><br>Palmer, who left the Etihad Stadium in 2023 to join Chelsea, admitted to being "confused" by Trump's presence in the trophy celebrations.<br><br>"I knew he was going to be here but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy," said Palmer, via the Press Association. "I was a bit confused, yes."<br><br>The US President would later express his delight at watching the Club World Cup final, as well as how happy we was to see the success of the tournament in the USA.<br><br>"I am having a really great time. Tremendous sport," Trump told DAZN.<br><br>"It's a big thing," Trump added, reflecting on the Club World Cup. "Gianni [Infantino] is a friend of mine, he's done such a great job with the league and with soccer - or as they would call it 'football', but I guess we call it soccer. But I'm sure that change could be made very easily.<br><br>"But it's great to watch - and this is a little bit of an upset that we're watching today, isn't it? So far. It's incredible."<br><br>Our MEN team of City experts will be on top of all the goings-on at the Etihad this summer and beyond, and you can get the latest updates and inside information to your phone by joining our new free WhatsApp community.
