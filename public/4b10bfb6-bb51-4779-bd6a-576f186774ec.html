"And also to help the team in every way I can and grow as a player, but also as a person.”<br><br>Speaking publicly after his move to north London, Madueke said: “I'm somebody who goes with my gut feeling a lot of the time and I feel like it's steered me in the right direction so far. So, I don't think it's going to be any different here. I think it's going to be a great success and I'm really happy to be here.<br><br>“I’ve just been relaxed, waiting for the green light and when I came in today, it all felt real. I'm really happy and really proud, so it's a great moment for me. It's great to go back home, be with my mum, my dad. I know my mum misses me in the house!<br><br>“It's already a great team with a clear identity and I can't wait to bring my style to the team and try and help the boys as much as possible to take that next step.”<br><br>CaughtOffside claim Arsenal are prepared to act swiftly to sign Rodrygo whilst rivals Liverpool are distracted.<br><br>The report says the Gunners will send an €80m (£69m) proposal for Real Madrid to consider, significantly ramping up the race to sign the Brazilian.<br><br>Meanwhile Liverpool are currently attempting to sign striker Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt, so have their hands full with that operation.<br><br>Takehiro Tomiyasu says he feels 'free' after agreeing to terminate his contract with Arsenal a year early.<br><br>The defender, 26, officially departed the Gunners sooner than anticipated. He signed for the club in 2021 for £17m and made a total of 84 appearances.<br><br>"It wasn't a sudden decision to leave," he told DAZN Japan. "First of all, I want to make it clear that my contract wasn’t terminated unilaterally, and I didn’t unilaterally say: 'I'm leaving'.<br><br>"We had a proper discussion and came to the conclusion that: 'This decision is best for me, for the club, and for everyone'. So I’m leaving. It all ended amicably.<br><br>"From my perspective, it’s the best timing. I’ll be free, and most importantly, the most positive thing about this decision is that it will allow me to focus on my rehabilitation and on myself.<br><br>"I was there for four years, but I only played five minutes in the 2024-25 season, and I spent a whole year in rehabilitation.<br><br>"I was under a lot of stress and anxiety. To be honest, I wasn’t feeling like I was there anymore, and I was wondering: ‘Is this where my future is?'<br><br>"After I decided to leave, I said my final goodbyes to the players, coaches, and staff. I went to the locker room or staff room one by one and said: 'I'm leaving'.<br><br>"As I said my goodbyes to each and every one of them, I was reminded that I was loved, and that was when I was able to leave.<br><br>"I think that was a good thing. The players were surprised, too, as I still had time left on my contract and I was injured."<br><br>Madueke is not expected to join up immediately on the pre-season tour due to his involvement with Chelsea in the Club World Cup.<br><br>He is entitled to three weeks of rest before then returning and could therefore feature at the Emirates Stadium in friendlies against Villarreal and Athletic Club before the Premier League season starts the week after.<br><br>Arsenal have confirmed the signing of Noni Madueke from Chelsea.<br><br>The forward has signed a five-year contract and becomes signing number four of the summer transfer window in north London.<br><br>Noni Madueke has taken to Instagram to post a goodbye message to Chelsea supporters, thus seemingly confirming he will be joining Arsenal imminently.<br><br>"I want to thank you for the Last 3 or so years. To every staff member that helped me along this journey, thank you. To my teammates thank you for everything, I leave with only love and admiration for you guys. We achieved so much this season and I honestly wish you guys nothing but the best. To Enzo Maresca, it was a privilege to play under you, thank you for trying to better me as a player and as a person. Lastly thank you to every single Chelsea fan.
