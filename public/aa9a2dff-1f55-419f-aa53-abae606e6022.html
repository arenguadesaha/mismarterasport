The pair previously formed a rock-solid defensive partnership at the heart of Liverpool's backline when the Reds won the Premier League title under Jurgen Klopp in 2020.<br><br>Injury setbacks and Ibrahima Konate's arrival in 2021 have hampered Gomez's development in recent campaigns. Nevertheless, Gomez - who has been subject to transfer speculation as Liverpool pursue additional defensive options - remains the club's longest-serving player, having joined in 2015, and stands as a respected member of the squad.<br><br>That status, however, didn't spare him from his captain's ruthless jibes during a coordination exercise where partners take turns dropping and catching a stick mid-air.<br><br>In footage released by Liverpool this week, Gomez can be seen fumbling attempts to snatch the falling stick, prompting Van Dijk to ruthlessly tease his friend, who eventually reminds him: "This is on camera by the way".<br><br>A visibly frustrated Gomez finally manages to catch the stick before attempting to turn the tables on the Liverpool captain with the same challenge.<br><br>While he briefly outwits Van Dijk, ever the professional, the Liverpool captain catches the baton effortlessly every time, denying Gomez any opportunity for payback after the brutal mockery he'd just endured.<br><br>The footage serves as further proof of the strong bond between the Liverpool pair. In 2024, Van Dijk publicly spoke about his relationship with the England international. "I think the closest I am at the moment is Joe Gomez," he said. "We've been through everything together here at the club, highs and lows and you know we are very close to each other."<br><br>Gomez has also shared his thoughts on Van Dijk's leadership since the latter became captain in the summer of 2023. "I'm incredibly happy for him," Gomez shared with The Anfield Wrap in 2024. "I can't put it into words. I know what it means for him, and I really get to see the inside and how things sometimes are tough.<br><br>"The little things that people might not see in a training ground when you need to make decisions or enforce moments when it's like, 'Lads, we need to be better at this' or it might be timekeeping, it might be different things that you don't want to slip out of place.<br><br>"Virg has done it in his own way, and it's made him even more appreciated amongst us as a team. His ability speaks for itself; he's the best at what he does, he's the best in the world and probably the best the club has ever had in that position."<br><br>Gomez was on the brink of leaving last summer. He found himself excluded from Arne Slot's squad at the season's outset due to doubts over his future and didn't make his first Premier League appearance until the end of September.<br><br>The 28-year-old was in the starting lineup for 11 of his 17 appearances, including nine in the league. Unfortunately, Gomez's bad luck struck again when a hamstring injury sidelined him for most of the second half of Liverpool's Premier League-winning season.</div></body></html>
