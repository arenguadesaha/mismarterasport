Now into his fifth season in the role, Paul follows the Reds home and away, wherever they play - including pre season. He brings you all the latest Liverpool news first each day, plus exclusive interviews and insightful, independent analysis. A journalist with over a decade's worth of experience, he has worked at the ECHO since 2016.<br><br>Trent Alexander-Arnold had been on the field barely five minutes when he found himself whirring his shirt over his head and charging towards the away end in celebration. It was a Liverpool goal that was marked as wildly as any other this season and that it was the vice captain who was saying it with his chest, quite literally, was instructive.<br><br>The shirtless knee slide left little room for interpretation as to his ongoing commitment to the club, even if there was a certain symbolism to be found in Alexander-Arnold seeing his shirt draped over the corner flag a few moments later. It's unlikely that it was a cute metaphor for him hanging it all up at Anfield, but that issue remains the six-million dollar question. For now.<br><br>Before that discussion reopens, it's fair to give ample credit to the substitute for getting his team over the line in what was an otherwise drab affair at the King Power Stadium. The leaders barely moved out of first gear all afternoon but secured a slender 1-0 win over the now-relegated Leicester City to move to within three points of the Premier League title.<br><br>The Reds may now even be declared as champions for a 20th time on Wednesday when Arsenal host Crystal Palace. Defeat for Mikel Arteta's side and Arne Slot and his men are title winners. It will be a remarkable achievement for the Dutch coach, barely 10 months into his career on Merseyside.<br><br>If not, Anfield plays host to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday for what will be one of the most memorable atmospheres in quite some time at that famous old venue. Those who have one of the golden tickets will almost be willing on an Arsenal victory at this stage.<br><br>Before Alexander-Arnold's timely intervention, Mohamed Salah thought he had scored early on but after rolling his shot into the corner, the 32-goal top scorer could only see his effort hit both posts before Leicester cleared. The Egyptian might have felt he should have done better later in the half too, although Kostas Tsimikas's cross was fizzed at an awkward height.<br><br>Leicester, who were vying to avoid becoming the first team in top-flight history to lose nine successive home games without scoring, thought they had made the breakthrough when Wilfried Ndidi struck the post but the visitors survived and the Foxes never troubled Alisson Becker for the remainder of the game.<br><br>Goalkeeper Mads Hermansen was involved heavily though, but the Reds were unable to get themselves out of first gear against a limited side who were there for the taking, had the intensity and quality levels been raised even slightly.<br><br>Perhaps it was the deflation of an emphatic Arsenal result at Ipswich Town that confirmed there would be no title clinching on the day, or the fact that Liverpool were already aware that their season will end with the trophy they crave more than any other these days, but the opening half was incredibly flat and might have been punished had their hosts been of superior quality.<br><br>Liverpool at least started the second period in brighter fashion but still found Hermansen in decent form. Substitute Diogo Jota headed wide from Dominik Szoboszlai's cross and Cody Gakpo had a goal-bound effort blocked by Ricardo Pereira after Salah's cross had caused problems.<br><br>It was the 71st-minute introduction of Alexander-Arnold that gave this otherwise sleepy Easter Sunday affair its major story, though. The result might have confirmed the Foxes relegation to the Championship but for the Reds' perspective, it was all about their match-winner and what might come next.<br><br>The 'Scouser in the Team' song that echoed around the away end as he came on was proof enough of a fanbase who are still firmly behind the West Derby-born defender, despite suggestions that Real Madrid's nauseating charm offensive is close to sealing the deal.<br><br>After Jota and Salah both hit the woodwork in a goalmouth scramble, Alexander-Arnold fired home with his left foot to set up the sort of celebrations that are likely to be commonplace next week if - or indeed when - Liverpool are declared champions of England.<br><br>But if the heat-of-the-moment of euphoria for Alexander-Arnold and his embrace with the supporters will be analysed to the nth degree between now and the formal confirmation of whatever the decision over his long-term future, it was an incident at full time that might give the right-back real food for thought as he makes his way back to Merseyside for a well-earned Bank Holiday Monday off.<br><br>As captain Virgil van Dijk nudged him forward to soak in the acclaim of those in the away end, who were crooning high into the Leicestershire sky about winning the Football League again and other such notions, Alexander-Arnold was beaming from ear to ear as he saluted their support on the day. Defection to Real Madrid and his standing in their eyes will plummet, rightly or wrongly.<br><br>"Virgil pushed me to the front to soak it in, get up close and personal," Alexander-Arnold said. "The fans have been amazing again this season, they have pushed us every game to the final minutes and they have done that again today to help us win the game."<br><br>Quite what happens next is still a mystery. That expectation had been that los Blancos had won the tug-of-war to secure his future but the murmurings of a rethink have been growing on the rumour mill in recent days.<br><br>Whatever does transpire, the future of their No.66 is simply a subplot to what the overriding storyline for Liverpool is this season. They are closer than ever to a second title in five years and the sort of scenes not experienced in a generation. Next Sunday will be appointment viewing at Anfield.</div></body></html>
