Returning from Fulham after a season-long loan that was cut short by yet another injury, his future always pointed to another move, however many had hoped that it would bring in a transfer fee for the Gunners.<br><br>However, football.londonunderstands that Fulham have again returned with a potential proposition for Nelson with manager Marco Silva known to be a big fan of the winger. Nelson underwent hamstring surgery like fellow Gunners players Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Magalhaes.<br><br>This meant he was missing from February until the end of the campaign and has only just returned to action and has been with his Arsenal teammates in Spain on their pre-season warm weather training camp. Despite his attendance, like Oleksandr Zinchenko, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Karl Hein, there is an expectation of a move away from the north London side.<br><br>News that Fulham are keen on another loan will not come as music to the ears of fans who are fairly asking why again the club cannot find a permanent solution for the 25-year-old. The answer however, while frustrating, is a simple one.<br><br>With two years left on his deal, having played less than 2000 minutes in the last three seasons, suffering multiple injuries in those times, the idea a club would commit a permanent contract and transfer fee on Nelson is rightfully unlikely. A loan therefore with a potential clause that makes the deal permanent once certain criteria, such as appearances, is met makes much more sense for all parties.<br><br>There is no doubt the talent that exists with Nelson who has experienced some brilliant moments in his stop-start career, including a wonderous winning goal against Bournemouth for the Gunners in the final seconds as they chased the title. It is a memory all Arsenal fans hold close and Nelson, despite his fitness struggles, is a well-liked individual among the fans and the dressing room alike.<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
