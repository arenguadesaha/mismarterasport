Matheus Cunha could make his first appearance for the Reds but other new first-team additions have been few and far between.<br><br>Bryan Mbeumo could be on the way soon should Brentford accept United's £70m offer for the Cameroonian. MEN Sport understands there is confidence in the Reds' camp that the Bees will react positively to the bid.<br><br>With this in mind, exit and new striker rumours are dominating the conversation and the Manchester Evening News have taken a closer look at what is being discussed surrounding United.<br><br>In an interview with the German publication BILD, former United manager and current Bayer Leverkusen boss Erik ten Hag was asked about the possibility of him signing Antony this summer. His response left the door ajar for the Brazilian.<br><br>"He has great quality," the Dutchman said. "I signed him twice.<br><br>"He was like a son to me, he still is a son to me. We're not interested in him at the moment, but we'll see what happens in the future."<br><br>What MEN Sport says: Moving to Bayer Leverkusen would be a brilliant move for not just Antony but United too. Currently, the winger's heart is set on returning to Real Betis, which is fine, but they do not seem capable of paying the sort of figure that United are demanding. If Leverkusen were to enter the race, there is a likelihood that they would be able to match United's asking price. The Reds cannot afford to allow every player to go on the cheap just to get them off the books so there would definitely be a few in the recruitment team hoping the Bundesliga club change their mind.<br><br>According to GiveMeSport, RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko would be interested in signing for United should they come in for him this summer. The Slovenian entered talks with Arsenal earlier in the window but it now seems the Gunners' priorities are elsewhere.<br><br>As for Sesko, who is valued at £78m, he is reportedly willing to give United priority even though they cannot offer him Champions League football.<br><br>What MEN Sport says: It is clear that Ruben Amorim would prefer to sign Viktor Gyokeres in an ideal world this summer. However, that ship looks to have sailed and the attention must now switch to other targets. Sesko would be an impressive second choice. He has a very similar profile to Gyokeres - he is quick, strong and has an eye for goal. What potentially makes him an even better option than the Swede is his age. He is five years younger than Gyokeres which makes him a more enticing prospect for Ineos who favour signings with potential resale value. It will be interesting to see if this progresses further.<br><br>Here at The Manchester Evening News, we are dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don't miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
