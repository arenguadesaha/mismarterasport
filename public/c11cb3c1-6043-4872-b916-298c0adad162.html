He was consistently overlooked for a place in the first team with loan spells at Alaves and Granada not setting the world alight.<br><br>He would be given a chance under Erik ten Hag as the United boss looked to resolve the club's attacking woes. However, his best run of nine appearances in the Premier League which culminated in one assist was not enough to convince the Dutchman that he should not be sold.<br><br>In August last year, Panthinaikos swooped in and signed Pellistri for £5.1m but United did edge their bets on the deal. MEN Sport understands they included a buy-back clause and a whopping 45 per cent sell-on clause on any profit the Greek club made on the Uruguayan.<br><br>These were included on the off chance that Pellistri managed to discover the form that saw United splash the cash for him in 2020. However, in his first season in Greece his form has been underwhelming.<br><br>He managed just four goals in 35 appearances and it appears already that his time in Europe could be coming to an end. According to journalist Joao Van Boysen, Brazilian giants Fluminense have targeted Pellistri as a replacement for Jhon Arias who is expected to be joining Wolverhampton Wanderers this summer.<br><br>If United are to receive a 45 per cent chunk of Pellistri's fee, they will need to hope that Panathinaikos make a profit on his sale. The Reds will receive 45 per cent of any amount that the club receives above the initial £5.1m which was splashed on him in 2024.<br><br>So, should Panthinaikos sell Pellistri for £7.1m, United would be entitled to a healthy £900,000. While it is not the amount that the Reds would have been dreaming of when they inserted that clause, it will all come in handy for Amorim as he looks to fund improvements to his squad.<br><br>Here at The Manchester Evening News, we are dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don't miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
