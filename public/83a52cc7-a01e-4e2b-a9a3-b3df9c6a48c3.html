A third bid of £65m plus £5m in add-ons has been submitted with United confident this will be the means of finding a breakthrough in negotiations that have taken place for longer than a month.<br><br>In a dream scenario, the 25-year-old is recruited with plenty of time to spare before the season begins.<br><br>Mbeumo would further bolster an attack already welcoming Matheus Cunha over the break. United struck a fairly simple deal with Wolves, paying the Brazilian's £62.5m release clause to make him their first signing.<br><br>Provided the former arrives on time, both should get minutes to integrate into the team over the summer, forming a bond before making the Manchester Evening News' dream XI for the opening day.<br><br>Their roles in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system would be to support the central striker in whatever capacity they can manage. That task is set to be difficult, with the manager's preferred striker undetermined at this stage.<br><br>Sporting director Jason Wilcox did not have to look hard to find Liam Delap and his £30m release clause from relegated Ipswich Town, though the former Manchester City youth star chose to sign for Chelsea instead. This created a significant stumbling block as the striker market has been crazy this summer - the rest seem to be tipped to move for at least double the price.<br><br>Hottest links came to Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting CP, Amorim's former student. The Sweden international appears destined for Arsenal though, so he may make his Premier League debut at Old Trafford yet, only for the wrong team.<br><br>Then there is Hugo Ekitike, another name on the register, who has reportedly agreed personal terms to join Liverpool, who have scuppered Newcastle United's latest attempt to land the 23-year-old.<br><br>Part of the puzzle in United's slow reaction to signing a new No.9 also comes down to who they must sell this summer.<br><br>Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Tyrell Malacia have all made clear their wishes to leave for pastures new. They are all out of the first team picture as a result but are still waiting in limbo as to where they will move.<br><br>Recouping fees, cutting wages and so on will free up the funds for Amorim and Co. to launch their next big transfer assault in full.<br><br>Perhaps one of those jumping ship, Garnacho, could find it in him to help his club one last time. With it reported that the Argentine winger prefers to stay in the Premier League, where Aston Villa are said to be lurking, there is potential for some sort of deal involving a player swap, at least in part.<br><br>Garnacho joins Unai Emery's team, gets to stay in England and showcase his talents whilst United take Ollie Watkins off Villa's hands. A win-win scenario for all on the surface of it as Villa are alleviated of one of their highest earners whilst his proven Premier League experience directly improves Amorim's dream XI for Arsenal entirely.<br><br>After that, United must decide what to do about Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, their existing forwards, who managed only five goals between them in last season's Premier League.</div></body></html>
