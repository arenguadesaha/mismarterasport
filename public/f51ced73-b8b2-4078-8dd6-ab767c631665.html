The latest is Nicolas Jackson.<br><br>Chelsea must be revelling in that. Two dates have been chiselled onto their honours' board, they beat United to Liam Delap, bolstered their attack with Joao Pedro, have tried to flog Christopher Nkunku to United and now Jackson has been bracketed with them.<br><br>Jackson was widely pilloried after he was sent off in the Club World Cup. In his first season in London, he was mentioned in the same breath as another Premier League newbie, Rasmus Hojlund. He should be a non-starter for that reason alone.<br><br>United cannot remotely entertain taking a busted flush off Chelsea's hands. They are nowhere near as keen on Nkunku as Chelsea have tried to suggest and Jackson is less attractive.<br><br>Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.<br><br>Every Tom, Dick and Harry who plays up front is cropping up in the United gossip columns. Dominic Calvert-Lewin is a free agent that Everton are better off without yet United's striker strife is so acute there is speculation about a possible move for him.<br><br>Apart from sorry Southampton, every Premier League side last season had a better striker than United. Go through the table and 18 clubs had a more rounded frontman than Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee.<br><br>Such reports are not of United's own making but they have given the impression that Delap was the only duck they had lined up as their new starting striker. It suited them to be linked with Viktor Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike but there was nothing concrete. Both are bound for Premier League clubs that qualified for the Champions League.<br><br>United might have edged Chelsea for Delap had they left Bilbao with the Europa League trophy among their hand luggage. United, reeling from their worst season in 51 years and with no European football on offer, are a tough sell to strikers.<br><br>Thirty goals in two seasons is not the pedigree of striker United require. Jackson is neither prolific nor proven. He was red-carded twice within six weeks at the tail-end of Chelsea's campaign and they have recruited two forwards in between those expulsions. Of course they want rid.<br><br>United have signed one-season wonder strikers (Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani, Cristiano Ronaldo) with a short shelf life while Hojlund was too young. Romelu Lukaku ticked most of the boxes yet he continued to be a peripatetic striker. Radamel Falcao and Anthony Martial were two gambles from Monte Carlo that bust.<br><br>And United also have form for settling any Tom, Dick, Harry or Wout. For all the mitigation surrounding the loan arrival of Weghorst in January 2023, opting for another Dutchman who grew up in the same district as the manager was beneath them. Weghorst was playing on loan in Turkey, having riled teammates and supporters at recently relegated Burnley. He scored as many goals for United as Burnley - two tap-ins.<br><br>The Weghorst deal was reminiscent of Odion Ighalo's deadline day move in January 2020. Ighalo was playing in China, back when the country's Super League was teeming with Premier League cast-offs, and he was represented by a Norwegian agent who was the same nationality as the United manager.<br><br>Ighalo and Weghorst were brought in as the support striker to Martial. Banking on Martial three years apart and under two managers is one of innumerable reasons why United are in the state that they are.<br><br>As recently as January, United gave consideration to signing Mathys Tel, a peripheral forward who barely scored for Bayern Munich. Yet United have a penchant for taking surplus squad players from Bayern.<br><br>On the basis of the Ighalo and Weghorst deals, any striker with a Portuguese connection should instruct their agent to dial 0161. Ominously, Portugal international Joao Felix is still technically a Chelsea player.</div></body></html>
