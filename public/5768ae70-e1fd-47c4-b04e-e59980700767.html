He currently covers sport across all regional sites at Reach PLC.<br><br>Manchester United are closing in on the signing of Bryan Mbeumo after reaching an agreement with Brentford.<br><br>The Manchester Evening News understands that the Reds have had a bid accepted, bringing an end to one of the summer's longest-running transfer sagas. United will pay the Bees £65million plus £5m in add-ons for their 25-year-old forward, who could now join before the club's pre-season tour of the United States next week.<br><br>Mbeumo's talents are obvious with a record of 20 goals in the top-flight last season. The Cameroonian will provide United with the Premier League experience they have been looking to attract this summer after acquiring Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers.<br><br>But it's his record from the spot which should draw the most attention. Mbeumo has taken 12 penalties in the Premier League since joining Brentford in 2019 - scoring 11 and missing just one.<br><br>That sole miss came in what is set to be his final home game for the Bees - a 3-2 defeat to Fulham on May 18. It's to his credit though that he still managed to score that day and in his final game for the club - a 1-1 draw at Wolves.<br><br>And his almost spotless record from the spot will now present United with a welcome but immediate dilemma heading into the new campaign. Reds captain Bruno Fernandes has been United's regular penalty taker since joining from Sporting in January 2020.<br><br>Fernandes has scored 22 Premier League penalties for the Reds - missing just four. It seems unlikely that United boss Ruben Amorim will change his regular penalty taker but it certainly gives him some room for thought.<br><br>It's a good problem to have for Amorim and he will be pleased to have at least one thing going for him heading into a vital campaign for him and the Reds.<br><br>Mbeumo's arrival won't fix much of United's problems but his signing alongside Cunha's addition last month will at least add some much-needed firepower to a team which badly needs it.<br><br>Here at The Manchester Evening News, we are dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don't miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
