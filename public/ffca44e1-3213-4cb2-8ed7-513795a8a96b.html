          <h1>Man City could soon break their own Premier League record after £138million windfall</h1>
          <div>On-pitch success might have been a little harder to come by for Manchester City last season, but their ability to make money shows no signs of slowing up.<br><br>Not long after banking £38million from their run to the last-16 at the first Club World Cup, the Blues are record-breakers again after signing an extension to their kit deal with PUMA.<br><br>A 10-year deal signed in 2019 has now been extended by at least 10 more years, and its value has risen from £65million a season to £100million a season. That makes it the most valuable kit deal in the Premier League.<br><br>It shows the value of City's success to PUMA and the growing size of their fanbase. Many of the kits in recent seasons have smashed global records, and unique collaborations between the two partners have also made waves within the industry.<br><br>It's now likely to be just a matter of time before City break their own Premier League record for revenues, which they set for the 2023/24 season at £715million. Those financial results for the year ending June 30, 2024, were announced last December, and the next batch of results won't include the money made from the Club World Cup or the increase in the contract with PUMA.<br><br>But eventually, those figures will be reflected, and while there is increased transfer spending to factor in this year, City also continue to make plenty from the sale of academy graduates. Their wage bill is likely to fall with the departures of Kyle Walker and Kevin De Bruyne and the likely exit of Jack Grealish.<br><br>Their struggles in the Champions League last season might have weakened their revenues slightly this year. They made £111.8million from winning the competition in 2022/23.<br><br>Last term, they went out in the play-off round, but the new-look nature of the competition meant they still played 10 games, five of which were at home. This would have boosted their return from the TV deal and matchday revenues. In the previous iteration of the Champions League, it would have required City to reach the quarter-finals to play five Champions League home games.<br><br>City have posted a profit every season since 2014/15, with the exception of the 2019/20 season which was disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. That is likely to continue despite their increased spending.<br><br>One reason they have been able to be so proactive in 2025, signing eight players so far this year, is that their revenues have remained strong, while their ability to generate sales from academy graduates can offset large transfer fees.<br><br>Now, they have more revenue flowing into the club. The Club World Cup money won't be repeated next year, but the success of their PUMA deal means that there will be an extra £35million compared to previous seasons.<br><br>If City return to the latter stages of the Champions League this season, then it could well boost those revenues to record-breaking levels once again.
