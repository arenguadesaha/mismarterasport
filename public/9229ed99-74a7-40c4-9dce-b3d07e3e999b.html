He joined the MEN in November 2018, having previously covered Burnley for the Lancashire Telegraph.<br><br>This doesn't quite have the intensity of the "happy flowers" monologue that helped turn Manchester City towards the treble 11 months ago, and it wasn't delivered with quite the same venom as that day, but Pep Guardiola's press conference on Friday carried a similar message.<br><br>His furious outburst at his players and his club back in January, after coming from 2-0 down to beat Tottenham 4-2, was credited with having an impact as City found top gear to win the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League. At the time it was an unexpected rant that exposed Guardiola's edginess in a title race with a new rival.<br><br>City eventually came out on top against Arsenal and Guardiola spoke at the start of this season about how pleased he was to see his players refocus so quickly after such a triumphant end to last season. But in recent weeks they have stumbled.<br><br>ALSO READ: Guardiola apologises to Phillips amid worrying admission<br><br>ALSO READ: Guardiola opens up on City form without De Bruyne and Rodri<br><br>After saying on Tuesday he was certain his side would win the league if they maintained their performance level, Guardiola subtly changed approach after his side were outplayed alarmingly at Villa Park. On Friday, he was talking about how he had sensed the club needed a "shake".<br><br>“The club, all the organisation, (know) we can be out of the Champions League next season," he said. “We have to work hard.

We’re still in December, not even finished the first round, we have a lot of games to play. The Champions League is there, the FA Cup. Nice, exciting, beautiful things ahead of us. Embrace them, we have to embrace it.<br><br>“The club needed it. One month ago I thought the club needed a shake, to be shaken. The bad results can help you to live that.”<br><br>While City currently sit fourth, it still feels unthinkable that they won't qualify for next season's Champions League. That is the kind of comment Guardiola throws in every now and again, such as when he talks of there being several challengers for City's title.<br><br>He is also insistent that complacency hasn't crept into this squad, but he clearly senses City needed a wake-up call of some description, a reminder of what it's like to lose games - or at least not win them. And as testing as this recent run has been, a City firing on all cylinders under Guardiola would still expect to have won at least two of the last four.<br><br>Guardiola will hope the hurt of the results against Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham and Aston Villa will have done the required shaking. An easier fixture list now follows, beginning with Sunday's trip to Luton which while unappealing, should end in an away win.<br><br>It's then a dead rubber against Red Star, Crystal Palace at the Etihad and the Club World Cup. Within a couple of weeks, City should have their first trophy of the season. The shaking might stop when the buzz of the winning feeling returns.</div></body></html>
