It’s not just about those working together centrally, but a right-back and his right-sided central defender or a right-back and the winger in front of him. Every part of the system needs to be in sync for it to work.<br><br>At City this season, the spine of the side looks promising, and that could be vital. The wingers are raw but exciting, and the right-back is still a question mark. However, in the middle, there is strength, from the experienced Ederson in goal to Erling Haaland scoring the goals at the tip of the team.<br><br>City might lack a little pace defensively, but the pairing between Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol looks secure, and it’s hard to see that combination being disturbed too often, especially for big games.<br><br>It got a chance to blossom last season when Nico O’Reilly became a more permanent fixture at left-back. Gvardiol has been keen to play in the centre of defence and his game suits being alongside Dias.<br><br>Both are combative defenders, but Dias is strong in the air and a commanding leader. Gvardiol is excellent on the ball and can pick a pass. Given time, they could develop into one of the best central defensive pairings in the Premier League.<br><br>If he can stay fit, John Stones will want to show he can still challenge for a role there, but Manuel Akanji and Nathan Ake now look like squad players at best, with Abdokodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis the next generation.<br><br>In January, it looked like Rodri’s long-term partner would be Nico Gonzalez, but after a bright start at the Etihad, the £50million midfielder has struggled recently. There is even a chance he leaves the club this summer.<br><br>His status has certainly changed, and the £46.3million deal to sign Tijjani Reijnders has signalled a change of guard.<br><br>Reijnders looked promising during the Club World Cup, occasionally filling in for Rodri, but his long-term status will surely be next to the Spaniard.<br><br>The Dutchman developed an eye for goal at AC Milan last summer and is a classic box-to-box midfielder. Already, his game looks the ideal foil for Rodri, especially if the Ballon d’Or winner can get back to his best.<br><br>Having Dias and Gvardiol together in defence and Rodri and Reijnders dovetailing in midfield looks encouraging for City. Of course, there will be rotation, and it is a long season when a player’s stock can rise and fall, but right now, the spine of this team could be a strength for Guardiola.<br><br>Kevin de Bruyne is one of - if not the - greatest players to play for Manchester City.<br><br>He leaves the club having won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, five League Cups and a memorable Champions League victory!<br><br>To mark his amazing time at the Etihad Stadium, this special edition has been produced - KDB The King - to celebrate Kev's career with the Blues.
