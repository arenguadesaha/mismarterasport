          <h1>Morgan Rogers sparks Chelsea transfer frenzy with Cole Palmer message as transfer truth revealed</h1>
          <div>Morgan Rogers has sent Cole Palmer a classy message on social media following Chelsea's 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final. The Aston Villa midfielder has been linked with a move to Stamford Bridge this summer as Enzo Maresca looks to bolster his squad.<br><br>Rogers, whose contract at Villa Park expires in June 2030, featured 37 times in the Premier League last season, scoring eight goals and providing 11 assists. Playing a key role in Unai Emery's side, he helped the Villans finish sixth and qualify for the Europa League.<br><br>The England international's impressive performances haven't gone unnoticed, with Chelsea said to be big fans. According to The Athletic, the Blues will be open to the idea of adding another wide player to the ranks if Arsenal wrap up a deal for Noni Madueke.<br><br>The report claims that Chelsea 'admire' Rogers, who briefly played under Maresca in the Manchester City academy. Nevertheless, the Aston Villa ace's latest activity on social media has sparked a speculation that a move could be on the cards.<br><br>On Monday afternoon, Palmer uploaded some pictures from the Club World Cup final to his Instagram page. The Chelsea talisman captioned the post, which has eclipsed well over one million likes: "Doubt us now."<br><br>Rogers joined the likes of Andrey Santos, Tosin Adarabioyo and Trevoh Chalobah in the comment section to show his support. He said: "Tell em again."<br><br>The Aston Villa ace uploaded a few pictures to his Instagram page a few hours later, marking his return to training at Bodymoor Heath. Chelsea fans flooded the comment section, pleading with Rogers to join Maresca's side.<br><br>Palmer and Rogers are close friends, and they famously share the same 'cold' goal celebration. Many thought that the Aston Villa star copied the former when he scored in a 2-2 draw against Chelsea back in April 2024.<br><br>Speaking to reporters at Villa Park after the game, Rogers joked: "Yeah, he [Palmer] definitely copied me. "It's my celebration. Check the timeline. I did it first. He's one of my closest friends, not just in football but in life generally.<br><br>"So, to see him doing so well, couldn't be more proud of him, really. I think he's now showing everyone what I and a lot of people knew he could do two or three years ago, so it's a pleasure to, and now everyone can see it."<br><br>Chelsea are FIFA Club World Cup champions. To celebrate, the club has launched a new collection with t-shirts, hoodies and more, including the 2025/26 Home Shirt with 'World Champions 25' printing.<br><br>Then, in an interview with TNT Sports following Aston Villa's win over Bayern Munich in October, Rogers conceded: "I'll let him [Palmer] have it [the 'cold' celebration]. He's scored 40 goals or something stupid. Can't really argue with that, can I?"<br><br>Want to keep up to date with the breaking and important Chelsea stories whilst on the move?
