The England international has signed a five-year contract with the club.<br><br>In doing so he has become the second player to make the switch from Chelsea to Arsenal this summer, with goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga completing his move earlier in the window.<br><br>Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard are the other two players to move to the Emirates Stadium so far. But the Gunners are also closing in on the signing of Valencia defender Cristhian Mosquera.<br><br>He may not be the final arrival with Arsenal continuing to work on a deal for Sporting CP star Viktor Gyokeres. The Gunners appear to be edging closer to the transfer.<br><br>With that being said, stay right with us on football.london as we bring you all the latest Arsenal news and transfer rumours...<br><br>Former Arsenal man Paul Merson has given his thoughts on a potential transfer of Viktor Gyokeres.<br><br>Writing for Sky Sports, he said:<br><br>"On the whole, Arsenal have done good business this summer.<br><br>"Martin Zubimendi is a top buy. Viktor Gyokeres is also a good buy, but we'll have to see whether his form from Portugal translates to the Premier League.<br><br>"How many players have ripped it up in Portugal and Holland but then not ripped it up in England? I'm sure people will be screaming examples at me where the form has translated, but he'll have to prove it."<br><br>Real Madrid winger Rodrygo will not be joining Arsenal this summer, according to reports in Spain.<br><br>Cadena SER, via Football Espana report that the Emirates Stadium will 'definitively not be his destination', despite links throughout the window.<br><br>It now seems that Liverpool could be the most likely destination for the Brazilian, with Luis Diaz a candidate to move on from Anfield this summer.<br><br>Hournalist Fabrizio Romano has provided the latest on the situation surrounding Rodrygo, amid interest from Arsenal.<br><br>The winger has found himself behind both Vinicius Jr and Kylian Mbappe in the pecking order at Real Madrid, with the Spanish giants said to be open to a sale this summer.<br><br>Speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano said:<br><br>"Rodrygo and Real Madrid will have more rounds of conversations. Rodrygo is in front of a big change, a big opportunity. He got the impression while speaking to Real Madrid that the club are not closing the doors on him. If he wants to go, for Real Madrid, the player can go. Those are the conditions of the deal.<br><br>"Seeing reports of €80m, from what I am hearing, Real Madrid want way more than this. They will probably start over €100m, then this price could be reduced. Real Madrid are opening the exit doors to Rodrygo. At the same time, Rodrygo has to decide. On one side, there is the opportunity to go abroad and experience a new club, another chance to be a star elsewhere.<br><br>"On the other hand, Rodrygo is still in love with Real Madrid. It is not easy for Rodrygo to make this decision. Rodrygo loves the club, he loves Real Madrid, he feels that he can still give a lot to the club. So it is a complicated moment, where he has to make a big decision. If Rodrygo decides to leave, there will be a lot of movements around him, for sure. From Premier League clubs, and not only. So, the Rodrygo case will continue in the coming days. More than by Real Madrid, this may be decided by Rodrygo himself."<br><br>Arsenal have been handed a potential boost in trying to breach a transfer stalemate with Sporting CP, with the club facing the possibility of missing out on their replacement if things don't move soon.<br><br>Sporting have reportedly identified Almeria's Luis Suarez as their replacement for Gyokeres, but face competition from other clubs.<br><br>Speaking to CNN Portugal, Ameria chief Joao Goncalves has now sent a warning to the club.<br><br>"Luis has had his best season, he's in the best moment of his career. 31 goals is a number any forward wants to achieve," he said.<br><br>"We haven't had any official contact with Sporting to date. We haven't received any formal or informal contact, but we have with other clubs, and we're moving forward with negotiations with other clubs. We're managing our timing.<br><br>"Fair value? He has a €40million release clause. To paraphrase Frederico Varandas - we're not asking for the value of the clause, but we're going to defend our interests."<br><br>Dragging out the eixt of Gyokeres could lead to them missing out of Suarez, and could therefore prompt things to move a little more quickly.<br><br>An Arsenal reunion could be on the cards in Italy with Serie A side Parma reportedly showing interest in Fabio Vieira.<br><br>The midfielder spent last season on loan with Porto, with his future at the Emirates Stadium uncertain.

"First of all, I want to make it clear that my contract wasn’t terminated unilaterally, and I didn’t unilaterally say: 'I'm leaving'.<br><br>"We had a proper discussion and came to the conclusion that: 'This decision is best for me, for the club, and for everyone'. So I’m leaving. It all ended amicably.<br><br>"From my perspective, it’s the best timing. I’ll be free, and most importantly, the most positive thing about this decision is that it will allow me to focus on my rehabilitation and on myself.<br><br>"I was there for four years, but I only played five minutes in the 2024-25 season, and I spent a whole year in rehabilitation.<br><br>"I was under a lot of stress and anxiety. To be honest, I wasn’t feeling like I was there anymore, and I was wondering: ‘Is this where my future is?'<br><br>"After I decided to leave, I said my final goodbyes to the players, coaches, and staff. I went to the locker room or staff room one by one and said: 'I'm leaving'.<br><br>"As I said my goodbyes to each and every one of them, I was reminded that I was loved, and that was when I was able to leave.<br><br>"I think that was a good thing.
