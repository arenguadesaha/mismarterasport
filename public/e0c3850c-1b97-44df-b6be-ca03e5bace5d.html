Christian Eriksen left when his contract expired, while Casemiro still has an uncertain future at United after entering the final 12 months of his current deal.<br><br>Kobbie Mainoo has a long-term future that is also unclear after being unhappy with the initial terms offered for a new contract at the start of this year. Head coach Ruben Amorim rarely started the academy graduate when fielding his first-choice team in the Europa League knockout stages over the final months of last season.<br><br>Guerra is in a comparable contractual situation to Mainoo, with both players now being over halfway through five-year contracts signed in 2023. United, albeit, have an option to extend their player's contract, which Valencia appear not to have.<br><br>Italian journalist Daniele Longo claims Guerra is leaning towards not renewing his deal with the La Liga club. Longo covers Milan, another club credited with an interest in the Spain under-21 international.<br><br>They, though, are said to be working slowly on signing Ardon Jashari after previous contact over Guerra reaching a stalemate in June. That contradicts previous reporting from Matteo Moretto, who claims that Milan made new contact yesterday and are negotiating contractual terms but do not yet have a deal with Valencia.<br><br>United are the only other club named by Longo, although there are said to be two other requests from teams in England and Spain. An agreement between the Reds and Valencia is purportedly pending.<br><br>Valencia-based journalist Hector Gomez, meanwhile, claims Milan have not left. However, he concurs that other clubs are there too, without naming names.<br><br>Guerra is reportedly waiting for an improved offer from Valencia. Moretto also acknowledged that the player's entourage purportedly met with the club earlier this month to discuss their client's future.<br><br>Manchester Evening News understands that United are still looking to bring in a striker this summer, though any future transfer business will be dependant on the club's ability to sell out of favour stars such as Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony.<br><br>Here at The Manchester Evening News, we are dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don't miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
