The Reds are in the market for a new centre-forward and despite being linked with a plethora of possible targets, two leading candidates have seemingly emerged.<br><br>On Tuesday (July 15), widespread reports claimed that the Reds had made contact with Newcastle United regarding star striker Alexander Isak and would be willing to make a British record offer to sign him.<br><br>As reported by the ECHO, no official offer has yet been made by Liverpool for Isak, while Anfield sources would deny there had been contact from anyone at the club to anyone at Newcastle.<br><br>But that is not to dispute the interest as the Reds weigh up their options ahead of making their move.<br><br>Isak is not the only player on Liverpool’s radar, though. They are also interested in Hugo Ekitike.<br><br>Newcastle were already in talks with Eintracht Frankfurt over a club-record deal for Ekitike and had seen one bid rejected.<br><br>Consequently, the timing of such reports did not go unnoticed as Liverpool were lauded by supporters for unleashing an almighty power play that screamed: ‘Either sell us your star striker, or we’ll sign your number one target’.<br><br>So perhaps it should be no surprise that this was followed by reports on Wednesday (July 16) suggesting the Reds had now made contact with Frankfurt regarding Ekitike.<br><br>It would appear Newcastle might have a difficult decision to make. Only, the Magpies have no intention of being bossed about.<br><br>Reports in the North East insist they have no intention of selling Isak, while they are pushing ahead with plans to sign Ekitike as their own talks continue ahead of an improved offer. They are said to intend to fight Liverpool on both fronts.<br><br>Yet while Isak has not yet signalled a desire to leave to St James' Park, he is still yet to sign a new long-term contract with the club. There is a growing feeling he could be tempted by a new challenge with the Premier League champions.<br><br>Newcastle will push ahead with their plans, yet the presence of Liverpool still looms large.<br><br>And both players will be aware of the Reds’ interest in their services as this transfer saga continues to play out.<br><br>To add a further sub-plot into the mix, the close relationship between Newcastle boss Eddie Howe, Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes and FSG CEO of Football Michael Edwards.<br><br>The trio grew close during their shared time at Portsmouth, with Edwards admiring both, as a longstanding desire to work with Hughes - leading to his appointment at Anfield last summer - emerged.<br><br>The Scot has been hard at work this summer, overseeing a £200m spending spree to bring in Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Armin Pecsi and Freddie Woodman.<br><br>A new number 10, full-backs on both flanks and goalkeeper depth was high on the Reds’ wishlist and quickly sought. Now next up for Hughes, a centre-forward.<br><br>Having played their first pre-season friendly of the summer last Sunday at Preston North End, Liverpool now don’t return to action until July 26 when they face AC Milan in Hong Kong.<br><br>Flying out to Asia at the start of next week, they will have to work against the clock if they wish for a new strike to be in place before their tour of the Far East.<br><br>Admittedly, a resolution might not be reached before then. But Liverpool don’t need it to be, with the Reds’ having their own outgoing sagas also continuing to play out regarding the futures of the likes of Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz.<br><br>There are many pieces still in play as Liverpool step up their efforts to bolster their ranks. And with their targets in sight, only time will tell how exactly this game plays out.<br><br>Newcastle might be proceeding as normal, insisting they hope to partner Ekitike with Isak and remain unflustered by the Reds.<br><br>But they have no control over what Liverpool do next as the Premier League champions weigh up their next move.</div></body></html>
