The Blues have jetted off to the United States and are making sure they get some relaxation as they recover from hot and humid training sessions.<br><br>Players have already been enjoying time with their families between their work as City look to give them as much of a summer break as possible having called them back early for this competition. They will take to the pitch on Wednesday for the first time, but there will still be plenty of downtime booked in.<br><br>One thing that won't be seen for the first time in many a pre-season though is a breakthrough moment for an academy graduate. Pep Guardiola has taken many over the course of his 10 years at the club and Rico Lewis, Oscar Bobb and Nico O'Reilly have all provided standout performances in recent seasons that have served as introductory markers for their first team integration.<br><br>This time though, there are none. Not a single player from the Under-18s or Under-21s was named in the 27-man squad that departed earlier this week, with the academy having a separate pre-season instead.<br><br>There are special circumstances given the Club World Cup, but it was only recently that Guardiola was expecting to take plenty of youngsters to fill out training sessions and ensure everyone got the rest they needed.<br><br>"We will go with the families, we will train when we have to train and prepare the games," he said earlier this year.

Even for the training sessions for some players maybe. I have to see, I have to talk with the club, with the manager for the under-23, under-18 and see."<br><br>Since then, however, five winter arrivals have stuck around and been joined by four new faces as the club have been aggressive in the two transfer markets so far. A third of the squad for the Club World Cup has only been with the club for six months of less.<br><br>In the meantime, the manager got increasingly bothered by having to leave players out of his matchday selections. Not used to having such a big squad precisely because he dislikes having players unmotivated by not being involved in games, Guardiola fought back against the idea that the squad would have to significantly increase for next season.<br><br>And so while new faces have joined, two senior players have left on free transfers and two more have been left to find transfers, while the academy players will be denied the opportunity of a breakthrough summer under the eyes of the first team staff.
