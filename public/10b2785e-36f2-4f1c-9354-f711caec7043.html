The Swede has been waiting patiently to begin the process of the move, such as a medical, but despite an agreement in principle on price, the structure and add-ons remain in negotiation.<br><br>Arsenal have other work to do and want to do it quickly, knowing they fly to Asia on July 19 for their pre-season tour. The club are hopeful that they might have announced Cristhian Mosquera and Noni Madueke by then but the move for Gyokeres and future targets remains up in the air.<br><br>Therefore, with so much transfer chat ongoing, it felt like the time for a Q&A session with our chief Arsenal correspondent Tom Canton. Here are some of the highlights.<br><br>Question: The big question everyone wants to know, Tom, is when is Viktor Gyokeres going to become an Arsenal player? This saga has been going on for weeks, if not years and it all looks like it's done, but why has it not been confirmed yet?<br><br>Tom Canton: This is of course the golden question and while some claims that the deal was close to collapse have dropped as many as three seperate times, the reality is both Arsenal and Sporting CP are hashing out the fine details of the move, the structure and how achievable the add-ons are.<br><br>Arsenal want Gyokeres on their flight to Asia on July 19 but the deal still needs to be completely finalised after the £63.4million total deal was agreed in principle. A medical and media duties and that long-awaited announcement video.<br><br>Gyokeres could join the team slightly later but their first pre-season friendly is now just a week away.<br><br>Question: With Gyokeres joining and other rumours coming through surrounding Eze, do you think this is the best window Arsenal have ever had?<br><br>Tom Canton: Add Eze, Gyokeres, Madueke and Mosquera to the three signings that have already been signed and there is a very strong argument that this might be the best transfer window ever. It will break records in terms of financial outlay too and Gyokeres is expected to become the most expensive striker in the club's history, eclipsing the £56million paid for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.<br><br>2023 was impressive and some of the late 90s windows that saw Bergkamp and Platt arrive also impressed but the sheer volume of this summer would for me clinch it.<br><br>Question: Do you think that Viktor Gyokeres will be done today? And what's the update?<br><br>Tom Canton: I would be very surprised if the deal is announced today, but the full agreement is believed to be close as the finer details are discussed. The crux of the issue right now is how achievable the add-ons included in the deal are. Despite the claims of a collapse, this is very unlikely considering how advanced negotiations are at this stage.<br><br>Question: Can we expect any more transfer business after Viktor Gyokeres?<br><br>Tom Canton: That will be dependent on some of Arsenal's outgoing business and the willingness of club's to be malleable around the sale price. While Arsenal have money, their potential to spend well over £200million will put them in the range of pressure of UEFA Financial Fair Play and the club are understood to always want to work comfortably within those restrictions.<br><br>If they can move on Reiss Nelson, Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Karl Hein and Oleksandr Zinchenko from both the wage bill and for some financial return, this will help give them more freedom. A move for Eberechi Eze could still very much happen this summer, and with the player now back from holiday, approaches are expected to take place.<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
