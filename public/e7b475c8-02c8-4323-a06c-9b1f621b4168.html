Just over £70million has been spent thus far, but that could reach nearly £200million if the latter three deals are all completed.<br><br>Madueke's switch from Chelsea can practically be considered done pending an official announcement with Arsenal then agreeing a fee to sign Mosquera from Valencia. Negotiations for Gyokeres with Sporting CP have rumbled on for the last week, but it finally looks as though a resolution has been found.<br><br>With his agents having reduced the fee they would receive, Arsenal look set to pay at £55million (€63.5m) plus £8.7million (€10m) in add-ons to sign the Swede.<br><br>As exits are expected, further incomings could arrive later in the summer window with Real Madrid winger Rodrygo and Eberechi Eze of Crystal Palace as firm targets.<br><br>With the Gunners set to fly out for their pre-season tour in less than one week, multiple transfer announcements will be needed and a fourth statement, arguably just as important as those signings, could arrive over the coming days.<br><br>According to BBC Sport, Arsenal are set to make a formal new contract offer to Ethan Nwaneri.

As was the case with Lewis-Skelly, he will likely be moved to the senior section upon signing a long-term contract.<br><br>Alongside the hopeful emergence of 15-year-old starlet Max Dowman, Lewis-Skelly and Nwaneri's impact could save Arsenal so much money in the long-term.<br><br>Considering the spending spree set to be completed this summer, any savings in certain positions will be welcome especially as Arsenal do not have too many sellable assets. Oleksandr Zinchenko, Reiss Nelson, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Leandro Trossard are a few names that could be moved on, though.</div></body></html>
