He previously also covered Everton for 18 years and followed England, reporting on the European Championships and World Cup final. Once had to tell Jude Law he does not drive a Mini.<br><br>And we're off. The most exciting part of the calendar for some football supporters is now upon us with the official opening of the summer transfer window.<br><br>Well, the first bit at least. Due to the contentiously revamped FIFA Club World Cup, the transfer window will initially stay open until June 10 before then reopening as was initially planned on June 16 and run until 7pm on September 1.<br><br>The current earlier period is ostensibly so those competing in the ill-advised competition have time to sign new players, although any club can utilise the window.<br><br>And Liverpool have already very much taken advantage of that fact by negotiating the £8.5million transfer of Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid a month before he was able to join the European Super League advocates for nothing. With the Bernabeu side taking over the last month of the player's contract, it's a deal worth £10m to the Reds.<br><br>A third of that has already been spent on strengthening Liverpool's right wing with the acquisition of Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen for £29.5m.<br><br>And the Reds are confident they can thrash out an agreement with Leverkusen for their highly-rated 22-year-old attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz.<br><br>The Germany international wants to move to Anfield, with talks ongoing between the two clubs. Liverpool's latest offer of a €130m (£109.6m) package inclusive of add-ons is still being considered by Leverkusen, who initially valued the player at around €150m (£136m).<br><br>Liverpool will also look to further their interest in Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez, who has been teasing a move to Anfield for some time. The 21-year-old Hungary international is valued at around the £45m mark.<br><br>And, of course, goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili will officially become a Liverpool player after a £29m deal was agreed with Valencia for the Georgia international last August.<br><br>So, what else should be expected in the coming weeks?<br><br>Alexander-Arnold won't be the only departure with a number of players facing uncertain futures. There is a possibility the Saudi Pro League could make a strong play to sign at least one Liverpool forward in time to represent Al-Hilal in the forthcoming Club World Cup.<br><br>Darwin Nunez has for some time been under consideration and was the subject of a failed approach from the Middle East in January, with Liverpool more open to selling the Uruguayan this summer.<br><br>However, Al-Hilal are also pondering whether to make a concerted attempt to lure Luis Diaz away, with the Colombian winger having talks with Liverpool over future intentions given the 28-year-old is approaching the last two years of his contract.<br><br>Diaz is also wanted by another Saudi Pro League side, Al-Nassr, who are preparing for the possible departure of Cristiano Ronaldo, while Barcelona are also contemplating an offer.<br><br>Federico Chiesa, who has struggled for minutes since arriving from Juventus last summer, is being tracked by clubs wanting to take him back to Italy, while Diogo Jota's testing season has prompted speculation of interest from elsewhere.<br><br>And given neither Nunez nor Jota were able to full convince in the number nine position, Liverpool are considering whether to pursue a new central striker. Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike would be one possibility even if the Reds finally thrash out a club record deal for Wirtz.<br><br>Cody Gakpo is a target of Bayern Munich although it is extremely unlikely Liverpool will entertain an offer given the uncertainty over so many of their other forwards and Arne Slot's high regard of the player.<br><br>A much more possible exit is Caoimhin Kelleher, with the Irishman having admitted he wants to become a number one goalkeeper. Brentford have expressed an interest along with West Ham United and Leeds United. There are, though, a raft of potential suitors including Bournemouth and Aston Villa for a player who, heading into the final 12 months of his contract, is valued at upwards of £20m.<br><br>The arrival of Wirtz would provide a further obstacle to more regular game time for Harvey Elliott, with reports suggesting he has already declined the chance of a move to Nottingham Forest. Brighton and Bournemouth were among those linked earlier in the year.<br><br>Kostas Tsimikas is another who could be on his way given the interest in Kerkez. The Greece international is said to be a target for promoted Leeds.<br><br>And the centre-back position could come under review depending on how talks progress with Ibrahima Konate over a new deal, with the France international relaxed over his situation with just over a year left on his current contract. Joe Gomez and Jarell Quansah were both wanted by Newcastle United last year, with the Magpies thought still interested in the latter although Liverpool are planning on having the 22-year-old in their squad next season.<br><br>Then there are the young and loan players. Liverpool will hope for interest in Tyler Morton after the homegrown midfielder failed to make a significant first-team impact this season, while teenage winger Ben Doak, who impressed on loan at Middlesbrough in the Championship, is wanted by Everton after a £15m bid from Crystal Palace was rejected in January. Doak is valued nearer double that amount.<br><br>Sheffield United have been linked with forward Lewis Koumas and left-back Owen Beck, who impressed on loan in the Championship this season with Stoke City and Blackburn Rovers respectively, while Luca Stephenson is open to a permanent switch to Dundee United after an excellent campaign on loan in Scotland.<br><br>It has been an exciting few days for Liverpool supporters. The real transfer business, though, is only just getting started.</div></body></html>
