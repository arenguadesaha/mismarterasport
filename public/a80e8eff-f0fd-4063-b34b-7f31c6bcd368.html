Enzo Maresca already has Robert Sanchez, Filip Jorgensen, Mike Penders and Gabriel Slonina in the Blues' ranks and, in the end, it suited both parties for Petrovic to depart.<br><br>Petrovic, who impressed on loan at Strasbourg last season, joined the club from New England Revolution in the summer of 2023 but departs after Bournemouth agreed to pay £25million for the Serbian's services. The goalkeeper has signed a five-year deal with the Cherries and will now join up with his new teammates immediately, ahead of their pre-season tour to the US.<br><br>After the transfer was announced on Wednesday, Petrovic explained why he felt the time was right to leave Chelsea and join Bournemouth. Speaking to the official Bournemouth website, Petrovic said: "I’m really happy to be here. I came to Bournemouth because I want to grow and I want to play at the best level.<br><br>"Together with this club, with these facilities, I think we can achieve it. I want to help the team get the results, improve every day and be a better player.”<br><br>Bournemouth’s president of football operations, Tiago Pinto, added: “I’m really pleased to bring Djordje to the club. The opportunity to sign a player of his calibre in the market was one we had to take, particularly given how vital the position of a goalkeeper is.<br><br>“We have been looking for the right talent to invest in within this area of the pitch and Djordje has very impressive qualities, as well as a lot of experience for someone who is still young. We are excited that he is the one coming to join our project and look forward to working with him.”</div></body></html>
