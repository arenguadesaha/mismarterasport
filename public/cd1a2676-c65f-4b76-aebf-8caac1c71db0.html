Many consider his best run in Pep Guardiola's team to be during the 2022/23 campaign, during which he registered 16 goal contributions as City went on to win the treble.<br><br>But that was some three terms ago. The season just gone, he found the net just once in a campaign where his side slumped to their worst Premier League finish in eight years.<br><br>And so, City have taken a clear stance towards their No.10. As the Manchester Evening News reported, nobody will stand in the way of his sale should a suitable, permanent offer arrive, though with reluctance a loan may have to be accepted in the England international's case.<br><br>Amid this saga Grealish has already felt the cold shoulder of Guardiola, left at home as the team went to play at the FIFA Club World Cup over the summer.<br><br>In terms of who City could sell to, the bookmakers have produced a clear answer. Grealish's former club Aston Villa are the latest 13/8 favourites to re-sign the winger, say Betfair.<br><br>Previous favourites Napoli are now 9/2 alongside Everton, and following that both Tottenham Hotspur and Nottingham Forest sit at 5/1.<br><br>Grealish's career as it is today was established at Villa Park, beginning aged six in the academy and culminating in captaining the club back into the Premier League via Championship play-off success. His continued strong performances in the top-flight then helped keep Villa safe in the division.<br><br>Because he then left for City at a time the club was still uncertain to stay above the drop zone year-upon-year, his £100m transfer hit supporters in the West Midlands particularly hard.<br><br>But Grealish's love for his boyhood club or his hope to one day represent them again would not diminish in the face of any animosity, and this was reflected in an interview with The Telegraph in 2021, months after his big money move.<br><br>"It’s a club that is so close to my heart and I definitely hope to go back there," he admitted with honesty. "That’s always been in my mind. Ashley Young has done it and I want to do the same, 100 percent.<br><br>"I knew some people would be unhappy when I left, and I can see why some were like that, but I gave my all for the club every single year I was there.<br><br>"If I score [against Villa], I’m not going to be celebrating.<br><br>"At the end of the day I’m Jack Grealish from Solihull who loves the Villa. That will never change - I’ve had a season ticket since I was four and been a fan my whole life."<br><br>Here at The Manchester Evening News, we're dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester City coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don't miss out on the latest City news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
