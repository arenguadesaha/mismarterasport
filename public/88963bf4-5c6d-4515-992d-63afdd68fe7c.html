It began all the way back in December 2024 when the Argentine was dropped for the Manchester derby alongside Marcus Rashford.<br><br>While Rashford's relationship with the new manager spiralled downwards from there, Garnacho managed to steady the ship but this would prove to be the beginning of the end. Strike two came against Ipswich Town when the winger chose to go straight back to the dressing room after being substituted instead of watching the rest of the match from the bench.<br><br>On this occasion, Garnacho was disciplined lightly with a food bill for the United squad deemed an appropriate punishment. However, he was as good as out following his antics on the week of the Europa League final.<br><br>Presumably, after learning he would not be starting in Bilbao, the forward published an image of himself celebrating against Manchester City in the last final he started. However, when he criticised Amorim indirectly after being given roughly 20 minutes of game time against Tottenham Hotspur, the writing was on the wall.<br><br>Amorim informed him shortly afterwards that he was free to find a new club and Garnacho's agreement has set the prophecy in motion. It is a particularly sad state of affairs for United fans who let the Argentine inherit his idol - Cristiano Ronaldo's - chant once the Portuguese legend left United.<br><br>While he would have perhaps preferred the No.7 shirt which was given to Mason Mount instead, there is clearly a part of Garnacho that wishes to replicate the career of his idol. And, who can blame him?<br><br>Ronaldo was a trophy-winning machine and was highly successful for United. Even after his exit in 2022 which was thoroughly unprofessional and worse than anything Garnacho has done, the 40-year-old has repaired his relationship with the fanbase and he remains an icon on the Stretford End.<br><br>Garnacho will not receive that same luxury. For starters, it is obvious that the 21-year-old has not managed to accomplish as near as much as Ronaldo and his insistence on remaining in the Premier League only harms his case.<br><br>When Ronaldo left for Real Madrid it was seen as a mark of respect that he did not play for another Premier League club. If Garnacho gets his way, he will be receiving a frosty reception at the Theatre of Dreams.<br><br>There is a lot of goodwill towards Amorim among the Reds' fans. Matchgoers respect what he is trying to do and the honesty in which he responds to critics and addresses the media.<br><br>That is not to say that Erik ten Hag was not well liked during the Ronaldo saga but there was a sense that the player had clearly done more for the player than the manager. Even having won silverware, Garnacho cannot share that sentiment.<br><br>In footballing terms, there is more than likely a better fit for Garnacho in the Premier League than Amorim's anti-winger system and the Argentine may not care about the legacy he has with the United fanbase. But the reality of the situation is clear and he has a long way to go in three years if he is to replicate where his idol was at when he left Old Trafford.<br><br>Here at The Manchester Evening News, we are dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don't miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
