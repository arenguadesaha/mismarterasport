But it looks for all intents and purposes that it is just a matter of time before his move to the Emirates Stadium is completed.<br><br>The Gunners have been long-term admirers of the Swedish striker, who has notched an astonishing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting CP over the last two seasons.<br><br>Arsenal look like they have finally got their man, with a deal agreed with the Portuguese side over a transfer that could cost as much as £63.4million if all add-ons are met.<br><br>Gyokeres wants to make the move to north London and all that seemingly remains to be ironed out is how the fee will be paid, with the breakdown over the payment plan currently being negotiated between the two clubs.<br><br>Sporting are due to receive £55million, with £8.4million in potential add-ons, but it has not yet been agreed how that £55million will arrive in the Portuguese side's bank account.<br><br>It is not expected that the terms of the deal will see it break down completely, with Gyokeres almost certain to become an Arsenal player. However, Arsenal may miss manager Mikel Arteta's deadline of getting the deal done before the squad fly out to Singapore for their pre-season tour on Saturday, July 19.<br><br>Arteta wanted his new big-name signing on the tour for its entirety, but that may well not happen now.<br><br>While that may be awkward for the Gunners' boss, Gyokeres himself has something of an awkward conversation waiting for him when he finally makes the move to Arsenal.<br><br>Sky has slashed the price of its Essential TV and Sky Sports bundle ahead of the 2025/26 season, saving members £192 and offering more than 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.<br><br>Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.<br><br>Gyokeres will not be able to get the perfect welcome gift he would have liked upon signing for the Gunners. Gyokeres has worn the No.9 shirt at Sporting CP for the three seasons he has been in Portugal and as the big-name striker signing at Arsenal would surely be keen to wear that number in red too.<br><br>However, Gabriel Jesus currently wears that shirt number and should Gyokeres want to take it, he would need to have an awkward conversation with the Brazilian, who, in signing for Arsenal for £45million in 2022, would himself have taken it knowing he was the main man at the club.<br><br>Gyokeres also wore the No.17 shirt at Coventry City, before moving to Sporting, and that number is currently worn by Oleksandr Zinchenko, although there are question marks over his future at the Emirates Stadium.</div></body></html>
