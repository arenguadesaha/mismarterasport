A senior football journalist, Theo joined the ECHO's sports team from Bolton Wanderers in 2018, having previously spent four seasons in the former Premier League side's communications team where he ran the club's website and social media channels. <br>A regular in the Anfield press box since joining the ECHO, since being promoted to Liverpool FC Writer, Theo has reported on Jurgen Klopp's side as they won the FA Cup and League Cup at Wembley, and competed in the 2022 Champions League final in Paris. A regular on the Blood Red podcast, Theo has also conducted a number of exclusive interviews during his time with the ECHO, speaking to the likes of Roger Hunt, Nicolas Anelka, and Alberto Aquilani.<br><br>After three years at Liverpool, Darwin Nunez's future at the club is in more doubt than ever. The Uruguayan joined the club for an initial £65m in 2022, with the potential overall package worth £85m had he hit certain performance related landmarks.<br><br>And yet despite arriving with plenty of excitement and huge potential, Nunez has never found a consistent place in the Liverpool team. He was rotated by Jurgen Klopp before the German's departure last summer and has since found it ever more difficult to feature regularly in the plans of Klopp's successor, Arne Slot.<br><br>A return of seven goals last season - 11 fewer than he managed the previous campaign - spoke to his struggles under Slot and after the Reds rejected advances from Saudi Arabia for his services in January, Nunez is widely expected to move on this summer.<br><br>So what would be best for Nunez and Liverpool? Our writers have their say:<br><br>The end of the road has surely come for Darwin Nunez. And for one very straightforward reason.<br><br>A moment to explain. During two years under Jurgen Klopp, Nunez, for better or worse, did exactly what quickly became expected of him.<br><br>There were the odd moments of headloss - although, in fairness, nothing like his mindless red card on his home debut against Crystal Palace was ever repeated - some rather poor misses, a lot of running about, some spectacular goals and a reasonably steady stream of more bread and butter ones.<br><br>If there was goalmouth action, it was a fair assumption Nunez wouldn't be far away from being involved. No player hit the woodwork more times in the Premier League during his first two seasons, only Erling Haaland missed more big chances and nobody was caught offside more times.<br><br>And with 33 goals and 19 assists over the two years in all competitions, it wasn't a particularly bad return even if the overriding feeling was it could have been improved.<br><br>But the arrival of Arne Slot as head coach has changed all that. The manner in which the Dutchman wants his number nine to operate doesn't fit Nunez's natural game, as much as the striker attempted to adapt during the first half of the season. That he barely started a game after Boxing Day tells its own story. So to does only seven goals all season and as many assists.<br><br>If Nunez remains, more of the same will be anticipated. It means Saudi Arabia could be an attractive proposition, although linking up with Diego Simeone at Atletico Madrid seems the dream ticket should the Spaniards make formal their reported interest.<br><br>And should Nunez leave this summer, he will depart with the good wishes of all supporters and as a Premier League winner. In that respect, he wasn't a failure as a player - it's more a case that Liverpool have evolved beyond what he can ideally offer.<br><br>The writing has been on the wall for Darwin Nunez now for a long, long time. He just doesn't fit under Arne Slot.<br><br>He started the season behind Diogo Jota in the Liverpool pecking order. And while briefly turned to once the Portuguese was struck down by injury, Slot's swift decision to then favour Luis Diaz in an unnatural central position spoke volumes.<br><br>The Uruguayan scored only five times in the Premier League this season. Starting 17 of his 47 appearances, only four came in 2025.<br><br>The 25-year-old remains a fan-favourite with match-going supporters, but he has rarely lived up to his potential consistently.<br><br>He is not a Reds flop, but the club's record signing has not worked out. While he ends this season as a Premier League champion, he has rarely still been Liverpool's 'captain chaos', at the heart of everything in the attacking third.<br><br>When that presence evaporated, so too did his place at Anfield.<br><br>The Reds need a new centre-forward who can trusted more consistently, and Nunez needs to be moved on to facilitate that. A switch to Saudi Arabia, recouping the majority of Liverpool's record outlay would be ideal.<br><br>Alternatively, perhaps the Uruguayan can be used as a makeweight. If Atletico Madrid firm up their interest, it would be interesting to see if the Reds could try to bring Julian Alvarez the other way.<br><br>Liverpool have to be selfish. Signing Nunez has not worked out, but selling him can at least give the Reds the best chance of bringing in the desired reliable, prolific centre-forward that the £85m man ultimately failed to be.<br><br>Darwin Nunez needs to leave Liverpool. And Liverpool need Darwin Nunez to leave.<br><br>Put simply, it just hasn't worked out for the Uruguayan at Anfield and a parting of ways makes sense for all parties.<br><br>There's no shame in that whatsoever. Nunez is a talented footballer and, if he finds the right home this summer, he's likely to thrive and show why Liverpool were ready to spend so much money on him in the first place.<br><br>And his transfer to Merseyside made absolute sense at the time. Anyone at Anfield to witness his performance for Benfica during the 3-3 Champions League draw between the two sides could speak to his potential. We saw both sides of Nunez that evening, the all action performance, goals and the offsides that have been a feature of his Liverpool career.<br><br>Under Jurgen Klopp, Nunez's all-action style suited the German's, at times, gung-ho approach to football. He got in threatening positions often and, even without scoring, would created chaos.<br><br>Arne Slot's more controlled approach has left Nunez looking out of place and while he coped admirably earlier in the season, he struggled as the campaign progressed and a new challenge makes sense.<br><br>So where? Well, finding a club to suit his style would be most important. And while Saudi might offer riches to both player and club, it might not offer progression.<br><br>A return to Portugal would suit, or perhaps a switch to La Liga with Atletico Madrid mooted.</div></body></html>
