          <h1>Chelsea and Arsenal make Rodrygo transfer feelings clear as new Real Madrid offer revealed</h1>
          <div>Chelsea will be determined get their hands on the Club World Cup. The Blues will lock horns with Paris Saint-Germain at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Sunday night as they battle it out for a piece of silverware.<br><br>While Enzo Maresca puts his players through their paces ahead of another difficult clash in the United States, he'll be hoping his higher-ups are working hard to bolster his squad. The west Londoners still need to get their hands on a new goalkeeper and some backup for Marc Cucurella.<br><br>There's a lot of work to be done, but there's plenty of time to welcome some more new faces to Stamford Bridge. So, with that being said, football.london has rounded up all the latest Chelsea news and transfer gossip.<br><br>Chelsea have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season.<br><br>According to the Spanish television show El Chiringuito, Chelsea and Arsenal recently approached Rodrygo's agents to enquire about his availability. The report claims that the Real Madrid winger views London as an 'attractive destination'.<br><br>However, it's said that the two Premier League clubs face tough competition for his signature. El Chiringuito reckons that Bayern Munich have sent Los Blancos an offer for Rodrygo in light of Jamal Musiala's injury and Nico Williams' decision to stay at Athletic Club.<br><br>The Brazilian is reportedly reconsidering his future, despite having previously been determined to fight for a place in the starting lineup.<br><br>football.london says: "If Rodrygo is available for a reasonable fee, Chelsea should make a bid. Unless anything drastic happens, he's clearly not in Xabi Alonso's plans, so a move SHOULD be fairly straightforward. If Arsenal get involved and drive up the price, the Blues should pull out and go for Morgan Rogers instead."<br><br>Chelsea have confirmed the transfer of Mathis Amougou to RC Strasbourg. The 19-year-old midfielder joined the Blues from Saint-Etienne in January, and he made his Premier League debut against Southampton the following month.<br><br>Amougou also briefly featured in the Conference League, appearing in the matchday squad for the final against Real Betis. The France Under-20 international has signed a five-year contract with Liam Rosenior's side.<br><br>football.london says: "Unfortunately, it didn't quite work out for Mathis Amougou at Stamford Bridge. That said, I think he was always set to join Strasbourg in anticipation of Andrey Santos' return. If he sets the world alight in France, Chelsea will be at the front of the queue for his signature (again)."<br><br>According to the German newspaper Bild, as quoted by Sport Witness, Chelsea have reignited interest in signing Karim Adeyemi from Borussia Dortmund. The 23-year-old forward has been linked with a move to Stamford Bridge in the past, but a switch has never materialised.<br><br>The report claims that the Bundesliga outfit want between €65m and €70m (£56m and £65m) for Adeyemi, whose contract at the Signal Iduna Park expires in June 2027. It's said that Newcastle are also keen on the speedster.<br><br>Bild adds that it remains to be seen whether or not either of the Premier League clubs would be willing to meet Dortmund's asking price.<br><br>football.london says: "Chelsea shouldn't touch Adeyemi with a barge pole! The Blues only bring in another forward this summer if it's a marquee signing. A big name. A ceiling raiser. I just can't see this happening. If Dortmund halved their asking price then they might stand a chance of selling him!"<br><br>Want to keep up to date with the breaking and important Chelsea stories whilst on the move?
