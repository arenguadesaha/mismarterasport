Views ranged from the rational to the ridiculous and sadly in some cases crossed lines which social media companies still need to do more in response to combat – we’re not holding our breath.<br><br>Boiling it all down, though, the main concern surrounding the move relates to the price, which Arsenal are spending on a player who is expected to be an option to help cover and compete with Bukayo Saka. Arsenal are using the summer window to reinforce and upgrade in multiple areas to give themselves a better chance of winning silverware next season.<br><br>Windows under Mikel Arteta have tended to take a retrospective approach and assess the failings of the previous campaign and respond accordingly in the market. The injury suffered by Bukayo Saka put the nail in the coffin to the already stuttering title charge during the 2024/25 season.<br><br>Then 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri was drafted in, but he, too, was soon injured, likely because of the load at a senior level put on him so soon in a position not believed to be his speciality. Arteta was very keen to add a player here, and when it became clear Bryan Mbeumo was not keen on competing with Saka and preferred being a guaranteed starter elsewhere, the pivot to Madueke proceeded.<br><br>There have been other needs elsewhere, particularly up top in the form of Viktor Gyokeres. But the left has also been in focus, perhaps more so within fan discussions than so far, the club’s aim to sign a player.<br><br>There are links for the likes of Rodrygo and Eberechi Eze, the latter of whom is believed to be a key target for the end of the window and can operate in multiple roles, including the left wing. Rodrygo is not guaranteed to leave Real Madrid but if he does, he will command a sizeable fee.<br><br>It is thought Arsenal would need to see some players leave before they can make their next major move having already spent big money. Yet the idea that a move for Madueke has stopped the Gunners signing Eze or Rodrygo simply does not add up.<br><br>Arsenal went into this window with one natural right winger, Saka, one fit semi-centre-forward in Kai Havertz but with two left wingers in Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard. While one of the latter two could yet leave, so far no transfer has yet materialised despite interest.<br><br>The idea Arsenal would add a third left-sided player before signing the two players to play in the middle or on the right does not add up. It isn’t the smartest way to build the squad.<br><br>Arsenal may yet sign Eze and/or Rodrygo and end the window with one of the best summers ever seen, but with what has been and is about to be done by the club, they have already done plenty to set themselves up for the new season in a strong way. How they finish the summer, however, could be the difference between a title and second place again.<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
