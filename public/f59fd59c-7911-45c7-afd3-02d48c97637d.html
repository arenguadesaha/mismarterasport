We're proud to represent England, so that will never change.<br><br>“Every game is big, we prepare for every game the same and we'll want to make sure that we get the win from that game just as we do every time we step out.<br><br>“There's no added pressure within the group but we just need to stick together.”<br><br>Toone came off the bench to score in that seminal Euro 2022 final at Wembley that catapulted the Lionesses, and women’s football into the spotlight.<br><br>Despite starting and scoring a brace in England’s send-off match against Jamaica, Wiegman opted to hand Lauren James a first start since April in the number 10 role, consigning Toone to the bench.<br><br>But like clockwork, on 60 minutes she was introduced alongside Chloe Kelly, who scored the crucial winner three years ago at Wembley, to try and make an impact on a game that already felt beyond England’s reach.<br><br>“It's hard when you're not on the pitch yourself,” reflected Toone. “I'm trying to watch the game from a hard angle so I didn’t really know what was going on on the pitch.<br><br>“I knew that if I was given a chance, I had to come on and try and change the game and that was my role tonight.<br><br>“There were definitely some positives to take from the game so it's not all negative.<br><br>“We had France hanging on towards the end as well and that just shows the depth that we have in the squad, people can come on and try and make an impact.”<br><br>It was James that had the most promising chance in the opening exchanges before Alessia Russo put the ball in the net and appeared to put England a goal to the good.<br><br>But, a marginal offside call in the build-up saw the goal chalked off by VAR, and England’s momentum crumbled with it.<br><br>It took the introduction of 19-year-old Michelle Agyemang and a goal from Keira Walsh to reinvigorate England’s attack but it proved too little, too late for their hopes of taking anything from their group opener.<br><br>“We need to look at ourselves for the goals that we've conceded, and we know we're better than that,” reflected Toone.<br><br>“On the ball, we can be tighter. But we showed a desire towards the end of the game and we put passes together and created quite a few chances towards the end.<br><br>“But that's always our standards. We could have won 7-0 and still there'll be things that we want to improve. That's just the mentality that we have in this squad.”<br><br>England now face the Netherlands in what has become a must-win fixture if they are to progress to the knockouts with the Dutch having triumphed 3-0 over Wales in their opener.<br><br>For Toone, it is a challenge England are more than equal to as they hit reset on their Euros title defence.<br><br>“Mentally, we're strong. We know what it takes to win tournaments, to get to finals in tournaments. We know how to play the game,” she said.<br><br>“We knew that we always had to win these group games to get out so nothing changes.<br><br>“We have the mentality to go again. We'll recover as best we can and make sure that we analyse the game, take the pros, take the cons and work harder next time.”</div></body></html>
