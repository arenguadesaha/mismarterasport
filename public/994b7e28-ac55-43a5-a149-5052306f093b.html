Joe has been at the MEN since 2018, covering Manchester United in that time as well.<br><br>Foden unlocked best position without Haaland<br><br>After years of Manchester City fans calling for Phil Foden to be given a run in the side in a central position, 2023/24 has seen him slowly move into the middle either from the wide areas or next to someone like Bernardo Silva or Rico Lewis as a number eight. He has looked good coming in from the right as a second number 10, although that influence has waned a little as injuries and suspensions have limited City's midfield protection behind him.<br><br>At Luton, Foden played as a definitive number 10, with a solid foundation of Rodri and Mateo Kovacic behind him. Bernardo came inside at times with Julian Alvarez pushed into attack with Haaland out. The injury to the Norwegian will obviously weaken City but it could unlock the best out of Foden and Alvarez. The latter looked like he enjoyed the number nine role better and Foden also thrived on the turn in the space between midfield and attack, as shown in his role for City's second.<br><br>He was City's best attacker and created the most chances for the Blues, often running beyond Alvarez into space. That is something he cannot do when Haaland is there and constantly on the shoulder of the defender. City will hope Haaland's injury is not as bad as it sounds but it could bring out the best in Foden.<br><br>ALSO READ: Man City player ratings vs Luton as Ake and Rodri good<br><br>ALSO READ: City show what Arsenal did to Luton to hint at Premier League change<br><br>Haaland absence puts pressure on Alvarez<br><br>At Aston Villa, it looked like Alvarez was in desperate need of a rest. He failed to help fill the chasm and he couldn't supply Haaland. He looked, to put it bluntly, like the player who has only had about three weeks off in 23 months given his move from Argentina and World Cup heroics. Now City may need him more than ever just when he may need to sit out for a game or two.<br><br>With Haaland suffering 'bone stress reaction' in his foot, the chances of a quick recovery don't sound particularly good from that diagnosis alone. Alvarez started in his favoured attacking position at Luton, enjoying the chance to run beyond the defence, and looks set for a run in that role for as long as Haaland is out. His assist for the winner was a welcome return on an encouraging afternoon.<br><br>He faces an obvious goalscoring pressure without Haaland in the side but it's an opportunity to show Pep Guardiola why he was signed in the first place amid a run in the team. It could be the chance he's been waiting for and that will trump any preference for a rest.<br><br>Midfield much improved after Villa horror-show<br><br>City's loss at Aston Villa came after they sacrificed the midfield by not playing any midfielders in Rodri's absence. When Mateo Kovacic and Matheus Nunes came on, they sacrificed their only attackers such were the thin options on the bench.<br><br>At Luton, Rodri was back (as was Jack Grealish), and Kovacic replaced John Stones. Instantly City had infinitely more control in the middle and Foden had more licence to attack as the number 10 knowing two defensive-minded players were behind him. Bernardo ventured inside to assist.<br><br>It was just more balanced and City's performance was more balanced as a result. They could maintain attacking pressure and keep the ball far better, keeping calm even when Luton scored just before half time. It was little surprise that a more experienced starting XI with players playing in their natural position resulted in a City performance fans have become accustomed to. The goalscorers, just when City needed them, were trusted treble-winners Bernardo and Grealish.<br><br>Kovacic put in his best performance since his Arsenal disaster and subsequent injury, helping Rodri and providing a link to Foden and Alvarez. Guardiola said the Croatia international and Nunes would have important roles to play going forward and this felt like justification in Kovacic's case. He looks better alongside Rodri - as most of his teammates do - and City will be keen Rodri stays away from any further suspensions.<br><br>Grealish steps up to restore control<br><br>Grealish has had a strange season. He's trying to prove himself again amid the arrival of Jeremy Doku, positioning himself as the control while Doku brings the chaos. It's tempting for fans - and Guardiola - to prefer Doku as the more exciting option but Grealish may get more minutes as the season progresses.<br><br>With Doku absent again Grealish, back from suspension, offered the much-needed control that City lacked against Aston Villa. It wasn't a perfect performance yet it was one that kept Luton pegged back for large periods.<br><br>Grealish will slow attacks down but keep the pressure on whereas Doku may concede possession more often for the opposition to counter or conserve. With City 'struggling' and four games without a win, Grealish delivered some much-needed calm to a game that had all the ingredients of an upset.<br><br>Luton fans taunted him and furiously appealed every decision that went against them, singing '2-1 to the referee' in the second half. But it was Grealish who had the deciding say with his second goal of the season and composed performance to turn a 1-0 half time deficit into a well-earned victory.<br><br>Josko Gvardiol continued at left-back despite a shaky game at Aston Villa and with Nathan Ake restored to the team. Ake went to centre-back instead of Manu Akanj and Gvardiol's hold on the full-back position continued.<br><br>Once again Gvardiol was targeted by his opposite winger and looked less than convincing when one-on-one. This was a game where he was given more licence to get forward and there were some good touches and driving runs on an afternoon when he spent as much time joining the attack as he did defending.<br><br>But did he help? Sometimes he got in Grealish's way, other times he miscontrolled and he looked like a centre-back asked to play as a winger at times. There was even a foul throw-in right in front of Guardiola, which never goes down well, and Luton had acres of space on his side for their goal.<br><br>Gvardiol will get better as he adapts to the position and it's clear he has a place at City for the next 10 years if he wants it. He will improve and this was hardly a terrible performance but it is perhaps telling that he was first to be replaced as City looked to protect their lead.</div></body></html>
