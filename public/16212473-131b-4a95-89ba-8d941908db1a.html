The sum is £4m greater than they earned the previous season when they finished third.<br><br>As is the case at the end of each season, the Premier League has revealed the breakdown of central payments made to its member clubs, which includes equal shares for the domestic and international rights, merit payments for both broadcast markets, facility fees for the amount of times featured in live broadcasts and an equal share of the commercial income the league receives.<br><br>The Premier League has confirmed that the Reds earned £174.9m for the 2024/25 season, with the club earning less in facility fees (£24.9m) compared to the previous season (£25.2m) even though they appeared in 30 live games compared to 29 in 2023/24.<br><br>There was also a reduction in the equal share that comes from the domestic broadcast rights, with all clubs sharing £29.8m and not the £31.2m from the previous year, although that was offset by the increase in equal share to £59.2m from £55.7m when it came to the international market, demonstrating the importance of the Premier League’s global strategy.<br><br>The share of commercial revenue was down for all teams from £8.2m to £7.9m, as were merit payments made from the domestic broadcast market depending on where clubs finished in the competition. Merit payments were also down from the international market.<br><br>What that meant for the Reds was that they brought in £20.8m from merit payments for finishing first, while the previous year the champions, Manchester City, had earned £22.6m.<br><br>In terms of the domestic market, Liverpool earned £32.3m from merit payments compared to City’s £33.8m last year.<br><br>Liverpool finishing third in 2023/24 was worth only £500,000 less to them than it was last season due to changes in the way that the Premier League money was carved up among clubs.<br><br>In a statement accompanying the release of the central payments to clubs, the Premier League stated: “The collective marketing of Premier League rights and the League's revenue distribution formula assist clubs in their efforts to develop and acquire talented players, as well as build and improve stadiums for fans.<br><br>“In its payments to clubs, the Premier League is the most equitable of Europe's major leagues and makes a significant annual funding contribution to the domestic football pyramid, community programmes and wider good causes.<br><br>“In season 2024/25, the Premier League committed more than £550m to the wider game.”</div></body></html>
