In less than four weeks, Arsenal will face Manchester United at Old Trafford in what is set to be an electric start to the campaign.<br><br>Before the Gunners lock horns with Ruben Amorim's side, they've got a few friendlies to play. Later this month, Arsenal will jet off to Singapore to test themselves against AC Milan and Newcastle before taking on Tottenham Hotspur in Hong Kong.<br><br>Once the north Londoners' tour of Asia comes to an end, they'll host Villarreal and Athletic Club at the Emirates Stadium. Arteta will then have just under two weeks to step up his side's preparations for the United clash.<br><br>The summer transfer window doesn't shut until September 1, but the Arsenal boss won't want any disruptions or distractions once the English top-flight is underway. Berta has more than enough time to bolster the squad, but he knows that'll pass by in the blink of an eye.<br><br>So, with that being said, football.london has looked at what business Arsenal must address before the opening weekend of the new Premier League season.<br><br>Arsenal has launched the new home kit for the 2025/26 season, featuring a nod to the Gunners' classic 1990/91 league-winning home shirt.<br><br>Arteta has already laid the foundations to a formidable title bid. The Spaniard boasts one of, if not, the strongest backlines in the Premier League, with Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba at centre-half, Myles Lewis-Skelly and Riccardo Calafiori at left-back, as well as Jurrien Timber and Ben White at right-back.<br><br>If Arsenal can add Christian Mosquera to that pool of talent, Arteta will back his side to keep the fiercest of strikers at bay. Not to mention David Raya, who, alongside Matz Sels, won the Premier League Golden Glove last term, the Gunners could keep clean sheets for fun.<br><br>Arteta will hope Martin Zubimendi can breathe new life into Arsenal. The 26-year-old midfielder, who Arsenal signed from Real Sociedad in a deal worth almost Â£60m, will give Declan Rice some much-needed assistance in build-up.<br><br>With Zubimendi dictating the tempo and recycling possession against low-blocks, Martin Odegaard will be given more freedom to roam the final-third. The Arsenal captain has always enjoyed unlocking defences, so, with someone else pulling the strings, he can focus on creating chances for his forwards.<br><br>The frontline has needed a fresh lick of paint for a while now, with Bukayo Saka often shouldering much of the workload. Fortunately for Arteta, Berta looks set to significantly upgrade Arsenal's armoury.<br><br>Viktor Gyokeres and Eberechi Eze both continue to be heavily linked with moves to the Emirates Stadium. The Sporting CP striker could finally give the Gunners the cutting edge that they've so desperately craved, while the Crystal Palace talisman provides Saka with much-needed support on the opposite flank.<br><br>In an ideal world, when Arsenal face United, Arteta will field a starting lineup that looks something like this: David Raya; Myles Lewis-Skelly, Gabriel Magalhaes, William Saliba, Jurrien Timber; Martin Zubimendi, Declan Rice, Martin Odegaard; Eberechi Eze (from Crystal Palace), Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP), Bukayo Saka.<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
