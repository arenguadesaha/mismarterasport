The Reds have already agreed to personal terms with the player on a long-term contract.<br><br>They have turned their immediate attention to Ekitike after Newcastle United maintained their stance on not selling Alexander Isak. Their fellow Premier League club have also ended any interest in the French forward after having a £70million offer rejected by Eintracht earlier this week.<br><br>Ekitike has now twice turned Newcastle down, the first time was three-and-a-half years ago, six months before joining Paris Saint-Germain. Here is a round-up of the latest on Ekitike:<br><br>Ekitike is said to have already submitted a transfer request. German publication Sport Bild also claims that the expectation is Liverpool will soon make a €100million (£87million) bid.<br><br>The Reds have reportedly indicated their willingness to meet that asking price. Sport Bild also acknowledges that the Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal have previously proposed an offer of that amount.<br><br>However, the Eintracht sporting director, Markus Krosche, reputedly did not pursue a deal. Sport Bild claims that they generally only accept transfer bids when informed by the involved player's representatives that they have already agreed to personal terms with the interested club.<br><br>Sport Bild also claim there was surprise in Germany when Newcastle made a bid. They purportedly did so to apply pressure on Ekitike, hoping that doing so would lead to a breakthrough.<br><br>However, the player is said not to have been convinced by the prospect of moving to Newcastle. Ekitike even allegedly hinted as much to a coach at Eintracht when pre-season started.<br><br>That is seemingly why they never agreed to personal terms with the player, rather than contract length or wages being an issue. Newcastle now reputedly have two other attackers on their radar: Liverpool's own Darwin Nunez and Victor Osimhen.<br><br>For the latest news and breaking news, visit liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc.
