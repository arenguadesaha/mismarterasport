The forward moves to north London on a five-year contract, football.london understands, in a deal worth £48.5million with £3.5million in add-ons.<br><br>He becomes the second senior Chelsea player this summer to make the move after Kepa Arrizabalaga and joins fellow summer additions Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard. Despite the expensive price tag, Madueke is expected to provide depth to the forward line, particularly to Bukayo Saka on the right-hand side.<br><br>Mikel Arteta highly appreciates him. He was keen to find a player who could push and cover Saka after the winger’s four-month hamstring injury last season all but ended the Gunners' title hopes. Madueke has been at Chelsea since 2023, making 67 Premier League appearances and scoring 13 goals.<br><br>His move has garnered a lot of attention, not all positive and he joins the club with a mission to prove a lot of the doubters wrong. As a winger whose profile is similar to Saka, a right-sided player who likes to cut inside on his stronger left foot to shoot, he possesses traits that Arsenal have been lacking in abundance.<br><br>Madueke is not expected to join up immediately on the pre-season tour due to his involvement with Chelsea in the Club World Cup. He is entitled to three weeks of rest before then returning and could therefore feature at the Emirates Stadium in friendlies against Villarreal and Athletic Club before the Premier League season starts the week after.<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
