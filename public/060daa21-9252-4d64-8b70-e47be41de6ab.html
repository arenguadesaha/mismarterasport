        <div>Viktor Gyokeres has already revealed how Arsenal managed to convince him to join. The Sporting striker has been heavily linked with a move to the Emirates Stadium for a while now as Mikel Arteta looks to strengthen his frontline.<br><br>football.london understands that the Gunners are in the process of finalising a deal for Gyokeres. The north Londoners reignited negotiations with the Portuguese champions this weekend, making formal advances over terms to complete the transfer in due course.<br><br>It's understood that communication has improved, and Arsenal are optimistic that a compromise on a final fee can be reached. Sporting reentered talks wanting €70m (£60.5m) for the Sweden international, with €10m (£8.5m) of which payable in add-ons.<br><br>But, the Gunners wanted to offer €65m (£56m), with €15m (£13m) in add-ons. The two clubs had agreed on the total cost of the transfer (€80m/£69m), but the structure of said deal proved to be an issue.<br><br>football.london understands that Gyokeres has turned down several approaches from elsewhere in favour of a switch to north London, so personal terms are thought to be a formality. The 27-year-old was previously linked with a move to Manchester United when former Sporting CP manager Ruben Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag in the dugout.<br><br>But once Arsenal swooped in, the Red Devils didn't stand a chance. Earlier this week, Gyokeres didn't return to training after reportedly telling the Sporting president, Frederico Varandas, that he wouldn't play for the club again.<br><br>Ironically, on the day that the Swede was due to report for pre-season, he told France Football exactly how Arsenal managed to win him over. Gyokeres, whose contract at the José Alvalade Stadium expires in June 2028, said: "It’s football, you never know.<br><br>"I’m not thinking about it, we’ll see what happens. If something is going to happen, it will happen. The most important thing for me is to play for a club that really wants me."<br><br>On the Premier League, Gyokeres said: "It’s one of the biggest leagues in Europe. I spent several years there without being able to play a single match. So, of course, it’s something I would like to do. It would be a great revenge."<br><br>When asked what players impressed him during Sporting's run in the Champions League last term, Gyokeres dropped another hint. He said: "Yes, of course, there were a lot of players who impressed me.<br><br>"When we played against City and Arsenal, you could see the quality that they have in the squad is amazing. You could see the midfielders like Bernardo Silva, [Mateo] Kovacic, Arsenal with [Bukayo] Saka.<br><br>"Centre-backs that I played against – Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba, very good players, good to play against those kind of players."<br><br>Arsenal clearly wooed Gyokeres with a pretty strong pitch, during which Arteta must have made the Swede feel truly wanted.
