The Red Devils remain eager to bring Mbeumo on board as part of their summer overhaul, following the earlier signing of Matheus Cunha.<br><br>United lodged their initial bid for Mbeumo in June and saw an improved offer turned down last month. Brentford have placed a £63million price tag on their star forward following Mbeumo scoring 20 league goals last season.<br><br>The Bees have reportedly pinpointed a potential successor who could help line Chelsea's pockets. However, United and Brentford are yet to strike a deal over Mbeumo and remain some way apart in his valuation, stalling any knock-on effect in the transfer market.<br><br>The Athletic has revealed that Brentford have expressed interest in former Chelsea starlet Omari Hutchinson, who made a £22.5m switch to Ipswich Town last summer. Chelsea negotiated a 25 per cent sell-on clause, which would provide Enzo Maresca's side with a windfall if Hutchinson does move on.<br><br>The 21-year-old is reportedly among Brentford's possible replacements for Mbeumo, although no progress has been made regarding the latter's move to United. Hutchinson initially shone for Ipswich while on loan from Chelsea, starring for Kieran McKenna's team in their promotion-clinching campaign.<br><br>The winger made his Ipswich loan move permanent upon the club's Premier League return last season. He was also a member of the England U21 squad that recently triumphed at the Euros.<br><br>The Athletic states that Hutchinson's contract carries a £35m relegation clause, which would see Chelsea gain £8.75m from a sale. However, it is suggested that Brentford's offer failed to meet the mark, and the relegation clause is set to expire on Tuesday (July 15).<br><br>The Ipswich winger has been tentatively linked with Everton, West Ham, and Fulham during the summer window. The looming expiration of Hutchinson's relegation clause may impact Ipswich's valuation later in the window.<br><br>Meanwhile, Brentford have stood firm on their asking price for Mbeumo. The summer has already resulted in major changes for the Bees, with manager Thomas Frank joining Tottenham Hotspur and Christian Norgaard signing for Arsenal.<br><br>Their resolve may have been hardened by the high-profile moves of Cunha and Newcastle United's fresh recruit Anthony Elanga, who both commanded significant transfer fees. Yet, Brentford are aware of Mbeumo's feelings about his future at the club.<br><br>Brentford's director of football Phil Giles explained the situation to Sky Sports: "There's significant interest in Bryan. I think it's been documented and publicised about, his preference," and "I think from what I understand he's also, if needs be, happy to stay at Brentford next year as well.<br><br>"Let's see on that. I think our position is that he had an unbelievable season last season, we expected interest in him. If that deal's right, there's a deal to do, if not then he'll stay. We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he's going to depart this summer. There is interest.<br><br>"He had a great season last season so it's inevitable there's going to be interest in him. If we get the right offer, there's potentially a deal to be done but there's only so much we can say on that."<br><br>Chelsea are FIFA Club World Cup champions. To celebrate, the club has launched a new collection with t-shirts, hoodies and more, including the 2025/26 Home Shirt with 'World Champions 25' printing.</div></body></html>
