          <h1>Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea transfer update as next attacking signing being considered</h1>
          <div>Chelsea have been highly active in the summer transfer market revamping their attack. It has already paid dividends with triumph at the FIFA Club World Cup, now it remains to be seen what else is done with ambitions next to challenge for the Premier League title.<br><br>Liam Delap, Dario Essugo and Joao Pedro were all added to Enzo Maresca's squad for the Club World Cup. Jamie Gittens was another mid-tournament signing but was cup-tied so therefore could not feature.<br><br>So the former Borussia Dortmund man is set to be added ahead of the new season along with the highly-anticipated Estevao Willian, completing his move from Palmeiras over one year after it was agreed.<br><br>Chelsea were unable to come to an agreement with Jadon Sancho so the winger was sent back to Manchester United at the end of his loan. Arsenal will also pay Â£52m to take Noni Madueke to the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>And there remains uncertainty over several more of Maresca's options, including Nicolas Jackson, Christopher Nkunku and Joao Felix.<br><br>With that, football.london analyses the latest Blues transfer rumours in what remains of the summer window.<br><br>It is not out of the realms of possibility that the Blues recruit another attack-minded player before the summer window closes, according to Fabrizio Romano.<br><br>He told DAZN Football: "Chelsea want to keep going on the market. My understanding is Chelsea are currently discussing several options for new attacker, this is because there is a concrete possibility both Nicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku leave this summer.<br><br>"Then, Chelsea are also discussing one more centre back internally."<br><br>football.london says: The idea of Chelsea wanting to part ways with an attacker in order to bring another in is interesting. Jackson, with certain drawbacks in mind, is still very much a striker in development and has been able to cope with the pace of English football.<br><br>Nkunku, on the other hand ,hasn't been able to get going because of injuries so might be the one supporters would naturally push towards the exit of the two. As for who would come in, does this suggest another striker or centre forward is on the radar or would Maresca be better off with another winger, especially if Madueke is to leave next.<br><br>Unfortunately there are few opportunities to answer these questions before the season starts as the club take their summer break before two friendlies next month. Only at that point will Jamie Gittens and Estevao Willian be able to join the squad.<br><br>The Manchester Evening News reports that Alejandro Garnacho's agents have turned down outside assistance from Pini Zahavi to broker a transfer away from Old Trafford.<br><br>Chelsea's interest in the Argentine winger emerged during the transfer window but he did not move. Instead he completed the season before being instructed by manager Ruben Amorim to find a new club.<br><br>Garnacho is therefore now part of a group training away from United's first-team looking at exit possibilities, though his representatives at Leaders, run by Carlos Cambeiro and Enrique de Lucas, are intent on facilitating their own deal instead of accepting the help of Zahavi's Gol International agency.<br><br>football.london says: If the Blues were to go after Garnacho this isn't the end of the world, it just may have helped their case as Zahavi has a very good relationship with the Stamford Bridge hierarchy over his role in helping other deals along in recent years. Zahavi is also Nkunku's agent but any thought of a swap deal involving the Chelsea and United players has already been put down, as Old Trafford decision-makers are not keen on Nkunku.
