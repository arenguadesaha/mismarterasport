As football.london reported earlier this week, the Blues are considering a move for the Ajax teenager.<br><br>Capable of playing in the middle of defence and at left-back, it is no surprise to see the Dutchmen is in demand with Premier League champions Liverpool also interested.<br><br>With uncertainty surrounding Ibrahima Konate's future at Anfield, it certainly makes sense that Hato is an option for Arne Slot, alongside Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi, especially with Jarrel Quansah also having moved to Bayer Leverkusen.<br><br>Liverpool's focus is currently on Hugo Ekitike of Eintracht Frankfurt and therefore Chelsea could take advantage with the bulk of their attacking signings completed. Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens and Joao Pedro have been the marquee additions with Dario Essugo and Mamadou Sarr also joining.<br><br>The impending sale of Noni Madueke to Arsenal is expected to help fund more deals with a replacement for the England international likely to arrive. Winning the Club World Cup and the prize money that comes with that may also significantly help their summer budget.<br><br>With Arsenal as long-term admirers, £40million has been suggested as his asking price but that is not quite the case it seems. According to journalist Ben Jacobs, it is possible that £40million will be enough to sign him but Ajax are now asking for something closer to £60million with Chelsea having made fresh contact.<br><br>Maresca and Co. will not have to worry about their London rivals in this deal at least as they have agreed to sign Valencia centre-back Cristhian Mosquera. That deal is expected to be confirmed very soon alongside Madueke's Chelsea departure.<br><br>In terms of potential replacements, Mohammed Kudus was linked but he opted to join Tottenham from West Ham in a £55million deal. The likes of Rodrygo, Morgan Rogers and Nico Williams have been linked but it will likely come down to Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho or Lyon's Malick Fofana.<br><br>Contact has been made in the last month for the latter but Lyon no longer need to sell their best players with their relegation from Ligue 1 not upheld. As for Garnacho, the Blues submitted several bids to try and sign him in the January transfer window but those were turned down.<br><br>It would likely be a different outcome now however, with the Argentine free to depart Old Trafford alongside Marcus Rashford, Antony and former Chelsea loannee Jadon Sancho.</div></body></html>
