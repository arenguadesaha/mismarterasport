The transfer saw the Blues earn a fee of £22million.<br><br>However, following Ipswich’s relegation from the Premier League, Hutchinson could be on the move again this summer.  A 25 percent sell-on clause  will see Chelsea benefit if that’s the case.<br><br>Much like the clause that allowed Chelsea to sign Liam Delap, Hutchinson is said to have had a £35million relegation release clause written into his contract at Ipswich. However, it has been widely reported that the clause expired at 5pm on Tuesday, July 15.<br><br>Premier League side Brentford have reportedly made a bid of £35million for the winger, a fee which reached a relegation release clause in the player’s contract. However  BBC Sport  reports that Ipswich were able to reject the offer due to all the cash not being paid up front.<br><br>Brentford are reported to be reluctant to reach Ipswich's asking price and are instead looking for other options as a potential replacement for Man United target Bryan Mbeumo.<br><br>If Brentford have walked away from the deal, it means that Chelsea will miss out on a cash injection of £8.75million. The expiry of the clause could potentially be good news for the Blues, if Ipswich are able to get a bigger price, then the windfall for the Blues would be bigger.<br><br>However, a higher price than clubs may have paid for him earlier in the summer is also likely to put any interested clubs off making a move. Hutchinson scored three Premier League goals last season and has recently helped England U21s retain their Euros title, scoring in the final against Germany.<br><br>The attacking midfielder has also been linked with Premier League rivals Everton this summer, who could offer Chelsea the chance to cash in on their sell-on clause should they formalise their interest.<br><br>Want to keep up to date with the breaking and important Chelsea stories whilst on the move?
