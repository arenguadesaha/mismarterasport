Rodrygo played a limited role in the FIFA Club World Cup under Xabi Alonso, raising further questions about his future.<br><br>This week, however, reports have detailed Liverpool's interest, despite Rodrygo having snubbed a move to Anfield back in 2017.<br><br>With that said, football.london has taken a look at what the Spanish press have reported about Rodrygo.<br><br>Diario AS wrote: "  The Brazilian is one of many that Madrid is considering for departure this summer. Several teams have tested the water and AS was able to confirm, Arsenal have been joined in recent days by a giant like Liverpool. The first step has already been laid: they will send a representative to the capital in the coming days or weeks to initiate official contacts.<br><br>"A deal that won't be easy. Madrid values their player at almost €100million. (£86m). A high sum, but within reach of England's most powerful clubs. Arsenal remains in the mix, though a bit further behind. After the signings of Mikel Zubimendi (€60m), Madueke (€60m), and potentially Viktor Gyokeres, the Brazilian will be the icing on the cake."<br><br>"Before making a definitive move for Rodrygo, Liverpool is prioritising the exit of Luis Diaz," the newspaper adds. "The Colombian's days at Anfield are numbered, although he won't leave at any price. For now, they've already rejected an offer of almost €70m from Bayern Munich, pending any offer from Saudi Arabia. The Munich club won't go crazy; they're considering Rodrygo as a backup. Unlike with Diaz, they would be willing to offer Real Madrid around €100 million for the Brazilian.<br><br>"This amount was budgeted at the beginning of the transfer window for Florian Wirtz first, and then Nico Williams. However, Bayern Munich will enter the bidding process once they see it impossible to sign the Colombian."<br><br>The paper adds that, ultimately, Rodrygo himself hopes he will be able to decide his own future and that his mind is still very much 'on Real Madrid'.<br><br>Marca wrote:  "All Real Madrid fans are wondering what will happen to Rodrygo. It's a mystery because "Mr. Champions," as he's known for his importance in some past victories, didn't have a prominent role during the Club World Cup. But has his situation really changed? From what MARCA has learned, no one at the club (neither management nor coaching staff) have shown him the exit door and we're already in July.<br><br>"The player has a contract with Real Madrid until 2028, and, most importantly, he wants to stay with the team with the goal to continue succeeding at Real Madrid. If it was to lead to a future sale, it doesn't seem the best in any case, since without playing time, the player's value diminishes. Anyway, the "Rodrygo mystery" will still be a source of much talk. We'll keep you updated."<br><br>Mundo Deportivo penned: "Rodrygo's future is currently a game of poker between the player and Real Madrid. There are messages from both sides, and the truth is that, at this point, the Brazilian's future remains a mystery. The player and his entourage have been reiterating for some time that his intention is to stay at Real Madrid, with whom he has a contract until 2028.<br><br>"The fact that Xabi Alonso did not play him in the Club World Cup hasn't changed that stance. However, there is one new development, which, according to sources in Brazil, is that Rodrygo wouldn't object to his departure, but Real Madrid must show him the door and let the Brazilian choose his future club.<br><br>"Real Madrid, for its part, has also been saying for some time that it isn't considering Rodrygo's departure, but that if the player wants to leave, they won't stand in the way. That is, with an offer of around €100m - he won't leave for a lower fee than that. This is the current situation between Rodrygo and Real Madrid. Meanwhile, half the Premier League, led by Arsenal, is paying close attention to everything that happens with the Brazilian player.<br><br>"And so are Real Madrid and Alonso, who are aware that selling the player would mean being able to enter the market to sign the midfielder the manager has been asking for almost since the first day he took over at Real Madrid."<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
