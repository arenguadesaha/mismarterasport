He previously also covered Everton for 18 years and followed England, reporting on the European Championships and World Cup final. Once had to tell Jude Law he does not drive a Mini.<br><br>This summer's transfer window has officially been open less than a week. But that has proven plenty of time for some Liverpool fans to get themselves worked up into a panicked frenzy.<br><br>The reason for furrowed brows and chewed fingernails has been the seeming lack of progress in attempts to sign Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez from Bayer Leverkusen and Bournemouth respectively.<br><br>After earlier news both pursuits had been ramped up considerably - Liverpool having a second bid rejected for Wirtz while efforts have been accelerated regards Kerkez - the lack of any developments, at least publicly, have prompted cause for concern among some supporters.<br><br>It's not as though Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes and his recruitment team have been twiddling their thumbs since the Premier League trophy was secured.<br><br>In the past eight days, the Reds have brought in a potential £28million from the sales of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Caoimhin Kelleher while spending virtually the same amount to trigger the release clause of Jeremie Frimpong and make the Bayer Leverkusen man Arne Slot's first new signing of the summer.<br><br>Throw in a pursuit of young Hungarian goalkeeper Armin Pecsi, the release of several Academy players and rejecting an approach from Barcelona for Luis Diaz, it has been a busy week or so for the Anfield hierarchy.<br><br>But these aren't the updates Liverpool followers are looking for. Kerkez's less-than-subtle flirting with the Reds on social media for several weeks, and the close working relationship between Hughes and his former club Bournemouth, mean there remains confidence even among the most pessimistic Red that the deal to sign the Hungary international will be completed sooner rather than later.<br><br>Instead, any anxiety is concentrated on the deal for Wirtz.<br><br>In some ways, Liverpool have already achieved the most difficult part of the deal by persuading the 22-year-old to move to Anfield ahead of Manchester City and Bayern Munich, the latter having been regarded by many as his next destination - not least the Bavarians themselves. With that in mind, the optics will not look good if the Reds are unable to drag the deal over the line.<br><br>But any suggestion the transfer is now turning into a saga is extremely premature.<br><br>Liverpool moved quickly to open dialogue with Leverkusen the moment it became apparent Wirtz was receptive to the opportunity of working with Arne Slot's Premier League champions. And the eye-watering amounts of money involved - the Reds had a bid of £109million turned down with Leverkusen wanting £125m, and have now upped it to a package worth £113m - mean there will be an understandable forensic attention to detail on both sides.<br><br>Transfers usually take time, and often the work is done away from the public glare. It's far from unusual for matters to become known only when a deal is nearing completion.<br><br>Indeed, in windows long gone, some potential transfers would go on for months before a resolution was agreed or potential suitors ultimately stepped away. By comparison, Liverpool's interest in Wirtz is moving along at pace.<br><br>Yes, there is a slight sense of working against the clock with the transfer window closing on Tuesday. But even then, it rather bizarrely reopens six days later before running until September 1.<br><br>If Liverpool fans are spooked by recent memories of missing out on Moises Caicedo and Martin Zubimendi, that Wirtz has emphatically made it clear he wants an Anfield move - and indirectly referred to such when addressing a news story on the transfer earlier in the week - should allay such fears.<br><br>But few should be surprised if there was no movement over the weekend with Wirtz still on national team duty for Germany, who face France in the UEFA Nations League third-place play-off on Sunday.<br><br>After that, though, Wirtz's international commitments are done. And both Liverpool and Leverkusen are keen for the transfer to be resolved as soon as possible so each can crack on with the remainder of their transfer business.<br><br>It isn't done until it's done. But there's no reason to worry over Wirtz. At least not yet.</div></body></html>
