He currently covers sport across all regional sites at Reach PLC.<br><br>Manchester United have submitted an improved offer to sign Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo over a month on from their original approach. United have signed just two players this summer and know they'll need to strengthen their squad further if they want to avoid a repeat of last season.<br><br>The Reds activated Matheus Cunha's £62.5million release clause early last month, bringing the Wolves forward to Old Trafford on a five-year deal with an option for an extra year. Paraguayan left-back Diego Leon has also joined Ruben Amorim's side for a fee that could rise to £7m.<br><br>And the Reds are now stepping up their efforts to complete their third summer signing ahead of the club's pre-season tour of the United States. The Manchester Evening News understands that United's third bid for the Cameroonian is £65m plus £5m in add-ons.<br><br>It is understood that there is confidence in the bid being accepted by Brentford. Attention will then turn to who is next as Amorim seeks reinforcements for his underperforming squad.<br><br>Midfield will need strengthening due to Casemiro's age, Mason Mount's injury record and Christian Eriksen's departure. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is one of the brightest English midfielders around at the moment.<br><br>Wharton is a Premier League regular for the Eagles, who played a huge role in their shock FA Cup win.
