Matheus Cunha remains the only new addition to Ruben Amorim's squad that has been completed this summer, with Diego Leon also arriving after a deal was agreed earlier in the year.<br><br>Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo continues to be a target for United, with a third bid being submitted to the Bees for the Cameroon international. United will hope to wrap up a deal for Mbeumo in the near future, which will then allow them to look at signing their remaining targets this summer.<br><br>One player who has been linked with a move to United is Valencia star Javi Guerra. The Reds have been credited with an interest in signing Guerra this summer, but will now seemingly face competition for his signature.<br><br>Transfer specialist Matteo Moretto has reported that AC Milan are now showing an interest in signing Guerra this summer. The 21-year-old's future at Valencia continues to be in doubt, with the report claiming that he is still waiting for the La Liga outfit to offer him a new contract.<br><br>Amid the uncertainty, Milan are reported to be looking to capitalise on Guerra's contract situation by expressing an interest in his signature. Valencia and Milan are not yet in talks over a deal for Guerra, the report claims, but the Serie A giants are apparently already looking to present a contract offer to the midfielder in an effort to tempt him into a move to the San Siro.<br><br>United could be in the market for a new midfielder this summer following Christian Eriksen's departure as a free agent.
