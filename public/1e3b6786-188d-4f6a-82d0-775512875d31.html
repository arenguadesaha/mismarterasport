The former are currently focusing on Hugo Ekitike after the latter ended their interest in the centre-forward.<br><br>However, as well as concentrating their attention on the Eintracht Frankfurt player, a long-standing interest in Alexander Isak remains. Arsenal were also, until recently, equally keen on the Newcastle number 14 and once had a striker who looked stylistically similar.<br><br>That links back to United as the player in question is Chido Obi-Martin. Confirmation of the teenager joining the Reds came in October following Premier League ratification.<br><br>Obi-Martin then began the first professional contract of his career after turning 17 the following month. However, all summer, it was an open secret that the Denmark youth international would be moving to United.<br><br>As such, the Manchester Evening News spoke to the then-chief Arsenal writer for football.london, Kaya Kaynak, about Obi-Martin. During that conversation came a comparison to Isak.<br><br>"He's quite a bit taller than most others around his age group right now and looks stylistically a bit similar to Alexander Isak with his languid running and technical ability," Kaynak said. United supporters have seen glimpses of that style so far.<br><br>Within three months of turning pro, his debut was against Tottenham Hotspur in February. That would be the first of eight appearances for the senior side last season.<br><br>Obi-Martin did not score in any of those games, all but one of which were as a substitute. However, he did get two goals in their post-season friendly against Hong Kong.<br><br>United have now named the teenager in their 29-man travelling squad for this summer's first fixture against Leeds United. As such, the teenager is back in his native Scandinavia, with the match taking place at Strawberry Stadium, home of AIK.<br><br>They just so happen to be the Allsvenskan team Isak supports after being born where they are based in Solna, just north of Stockholm City Centre. He started playing for their youth teams at six before breaking into the first team a decade later.<br><br>Isak scored 13 goals in 29 appearances before signing for Borussia Dortmund barely six months after turning pro. Obi-Martin can, therefore, literally follow in his footsteps this weekend.<br><br>Here at The Manchester Evening News, we are dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don't miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
