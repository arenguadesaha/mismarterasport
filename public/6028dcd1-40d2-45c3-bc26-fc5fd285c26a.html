You can follow Steven on Twitter at @StevenRailston.<br><br>Manchester United will play Leeds in Stockholm for their opening pre-season friendly.<br><br>United will take on newly promoted Leeds on July 19. Then, they will travel across the Atlantic to face West Ham, Bournemouth, and Everton in the Premier League Summer Series.<br><br>Ruben Amorim is likely to give several youngsters minutes against Leeds, but places in the USA tour squad will be limited in comparison and academy prospects will be hopeful of making the cut.<br><br>So here are the young players who could impress Amorim in pre-season...<br><br>Jack Moorhouse's injury problems seem to be behind him. He is a special ball carrier - he drives the U21s into dangerous areas - and has been named in four first-team matchday squads.<br><br>Moorhouse is a perfect fit to play in one of the No.10 roles in Amorim's system, and he's one of a few youngsters who have caught the attention of United's head coach since his arrival.<br><br>Mantato is considered a rising star in the academy and the MEN reported in November that his chances of breaking into the first-team had been increased by Amorim's arrival because he has the ideal blend of qualities to play at wing-back.<br><br>Mantato formerly played at left-back in academy fixtures, but he's gradually progressed to predominantly play on the right wing, meaning he's got quality in defensive and attacking areas.<br><br>Godwill Kukonki was been given a taste of the senior set-up last season, despite only turning 17 in January, and he is seen as someone who would excel playing in Amorim's system.<br><br>Kukonki is a left-footed centre-back and they are worth their weight in gold in the modern game.<br><br>Amir Ibragimov trained with the first-team at 15 years old at the beginning of 2023, and signed his first professional contract in April after celebrating his 17th birthday.<br><br>The tenacious Ibragimov has been compared to Wayne Rooney and is a relentless hard worker.<br><br>Last season, Harry Amass made his debut against Leicester at the King Power Stadium and his first start for United against Newcastle. Amass has looked comfortable at the top level, and his performances have suggested he could play a permanent role in the senior squad in 2025/2026.<br><br>Shea Lacey missed time on the pitch in the first half of last season due to injury, and he was carefully handled at the business end to ensure he is primed for a clear run at the new campaign.<br><br>Lacey has big potential and he will be desperate to show what he can do in pre-season. The youngster has already been compared to Phil Foden and he has a wand of a left foot.<br><br>Chido Obi has a huge profile due to his prolific goalscoring record in academy matches. Amorim has given Obi a handful of cameos and he is certain to feature in pre-season this summer.<br><br>The 17-year-old still has improvements to make and his ceiling is far from being reached.<br><br>Jaydan Kamason was exceptional for the U18s last season. His performance against Arsenal in the FA Youth Cup quarter-finals was superb and he has been involved in senior training at Carrington.<br><br>Kamason, who could play in the right wing-back role in Amorim's system, was named on the bench for both of United's games against Lyon in April, and he has a bright future.<br><br>Jack Fletcher enjoyed a brilliant first half of 2024/2025, scoring important goals in the EFL Trophy campaign and proving himself against the likes of Doncaster, Barnsley and Bolton.<br><br>Fletcher was key in the FA Youth Cup run and he is another exciting young talent.<br><br>Elyh Harrison is probably the most highly regarded goalkeeper to come through the academy since Dean Henderson and his distribution is a strength, which will stand him in good stead.<br><br>Harrison spent the first half of last season on loan with Chester before being recalled to United in January. He kept seven clean sheets in 18 starts and conceded just 16 goals in that period.</div></body></html>
