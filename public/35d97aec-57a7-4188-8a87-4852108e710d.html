The striker's career had to take an unexpected turn as his only option left was a loan to Galatasaray.<br><br>The 26-year-old enjoyed his season Turkey, scoring 37 in 41 matches. In fact, it appears he enjoyed it so much that it is his current plan to return to Istanbul should his parent club agree terms with the Super Lig outfit.<br><br>Osimhen has reportedly not returned for pre-season training in Naples in order to force through the switch.<br><br>Whilst there is this strong sense that Galatasaray will be his destination once again, it is not a deal fully agreed yet and therefore there remains enough wriggle room for rumours of a transfer hijacking.<br><br>Paris Saint-Germain are one adversary who have been tied to the saga and now so have Chelsea's top-flight rivals Newcastle United.<br><br>That is according to BILD, who speculatively believe Eddie Howe and Co. have turned their attention to the Nigerian international and Liverpool's Darwin Nunez.<br><br>This comes in the aftermath of the Anfield club reportedly agreeing personal terms with Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike, the striker Newcastle had attempted to sign earlier this week before having yet another target stolen away.<br><br>Not short of money with their Saudi Arabian backers, the Magpies - like the Blues - have been linked with Osimhen numerous times in the past.<br><br>Chelsea were once again linked with a move for Osimhen at the beginning of the current transfer window, before signing Liam Delap from Ipswich Town.<br><br>But like a possible move to Stamford Bridge, the opportunity appears to be going away fast. The latest update from Belgian reporter Sacha Tavolieri claims a total agreement is in place between negotiators in Italy and Turkey.<br><br>Osimhen appears set to return to his former loan employers for a total €75m (£67m) package.</div></body></html>
