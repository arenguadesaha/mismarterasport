As things stand, Arne Slot is heading into the new season with three senior centre-backs.<br><br>And the situation of Ibrahima Konate's contract makes that fact even more precarious. At the beginning of 2025 the Frenchman, 26, revealed he received an offer from Liverpool to renew his deal but put down rumours that he was close to doing so.<br><br>All of this is to be discussed within the walls of Anfield as Real Madrid seemingly prepare to break the door down. The La Liga giants continue to be linked with interest in the defender and securing his signing for free in one year's time, just as they tempted Trent Alexander-Arnold to depart his boyhood club this summer.<br><br>And so, the ECHO gathers the latest Liverpool transfer news and rumours this Friday, July 18.<br><br>Los Blancos have proven they are more than capable of playing the long game, waiting for some of football's top talents to run down their contract with the promise they will swoop.<br><br>What could scupper their plan with regards to Konate is if Liverpool were to swiftly decide they want to cash in on their No.5 before it is too late.<br><br>But Real would not be under any pressure to pay a premium fee for Konate in the current climate. Cadena SER claim the most they are willing to pay to complete the transfer this summer is €20-25m (£17.2-21.6m) - that is significantly less than the France international's €60m (£51m) Transfermarkt evaluation estimate.<br><br>So, it is said Madrid are laying the groundwork to be able to pounce once they are legally allowed to negotiate directly with Konate from January 1, 2026.<br><br>Leaving Liverpool in the position of having three senior centre-backs was Jarell Quansah, who departed for Bayer Leverkusen earlier this month. The 22-year-old moved to Germany for £30m upfront, £5m in possible add-ons and with a buyback clause thought to be around the £51m mark.<br><br>The Reds are relaxed as they look ahead to potential replacements.<br><br>Meanwhile, Quansah has now spoken to BILD about his decision to join Leverkusen this summer.<br><br>The England Under-21 international said: "I learned a lot at Liverpool, and I can't thank everyone enough for that. But I've found my own path in football and am now ready for the next step.<br><br>"Leverkusen tried very hard to get me, it was very professional. It was clear to me that Leverkusen would be my first choice if I were to move. If you read the internet, you'll find 100 rumours and 1,000 teams that are supposedly interested in you. As far as I'm concerned, there was only one team with serious intentions."<br><br>About his former teammate Virgil van Dijk and the lessons he has passed down, Quansah responded: "What he has is unique, the structure with which he plays. You can't replicate everything.<br><br>"I can't single anyone out because I've learned from all the defenders at Liverpool. I think they're happy with my development. I hope I'll reach their potential one day."</div></body></html>
