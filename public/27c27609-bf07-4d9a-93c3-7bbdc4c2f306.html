The England international will join fellow summer additions Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard in the Arsenal squad for next season.<br><br>With the impact of Bukayo Saka’s major injury last summer, Mikel Arteta and the club were keen to add a player who would help ease the weight of minutes on the Hale Ender. Madueke certainly represents that.<br><br>The winger has since been speaking to the club’s official website. It is something of a long-awaited piece of media for fans considering the amount of discourse surrounding this transfer.<br><br>“I'm somebody who goes with my gut feeling a lot of the time and I feel like it's steered me in the right direction so far," Madueke said. "So, I don't think it's going to be any different here. I think it's going to be a great success and I'm really happy to be here.<br><br>“I’ve just been relaxed, waiting for the green light and when I came in today, it all felt real. I'm really happy and really proud, so it's a great moment for me. It's great to go back home, be with my mum, my dad. I know my mum misses me in the house!<br><br>“It's already a great team with a clear identity and I can't wait to bring my style to the team and try and help the boys as much as possible to take that next step.”<br><br>When pressed about his aims for the upcoming campaign, the winger added: “To win all the competitions we're in, I feel like we're definitely capable of doing that. And also to help the team in every way I can and grow as a player, but also as a person.”<br><br>Madueke will be allowed a break having played for Chelsea at the Club World Cup. There is a chance he could join up with the team in Asia but more likely will make his debut in the matches at the Emirates Stadium against Villarreal and Athletic Club.<br><br>“I've spoken to Dec, Myles, Bukayo, even Jurrien as well and they all say amazing things about the club and the culture here, how warm it is and how much of a family it is,” Madueke said. “I’m really happy to be a part of the Arsenal family now.<br><br>“I'm very happy, very excited to get to work. I’ll go on holiday for a little bit now, but I can't wait to get back and meet all the boys and train. I was saying it to all my friends walking around here, you don't even want to take the rest. I know I have to for my body and stuff to heal, but when I come back, I'll be raring to go.”</div></body></html>
