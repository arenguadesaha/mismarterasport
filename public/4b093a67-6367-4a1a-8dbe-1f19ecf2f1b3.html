But his future is already coming under scrutiny after the arrival of Reijnders.<br><br>If a brutal decision is taken on the Spaniard then decisions, either to leave the club on loan or on a permanent basis, could also be taken on the likes of Vitor Reis, Oscar Bobb among others.<br><br>Grealish's omission from City's Club World Cup squad seemingly spelt the end of his time at the club as they look to move on the man they paid £100million to sign in the summer of 2021.<br><br>The 29-year-old will attract interest from a number of Premier League clubs but City must ensure they find a deal that suits them. Same goes for Kalvin Phillips who is surplus to requirements at the Etihad Stadium.</div></body></html>
