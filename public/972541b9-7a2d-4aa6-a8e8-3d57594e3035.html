Whether that be in the Caribbean like Cole Palmer, or in Orlando like Marc Cucurella, the Chelsea players have been allowed three weeks off to relax and spend time with their families.<br><br>For the sporting directors, Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart who were both in attendance at the MetLife Stadium on Sunday, their hard work will continue over the next few weeks. Chelsea are still looking at signing a defender before the transfer window closes and Hato, who can be used as a left-back or in the middle, has emerged as a big target for the west Londoners.<br><br>The 19-year-old Ajax defender is highly sought after this summer with Liverpool said to be keeping a close eye on his situation as well. Chelsea, though, are considering making a move for the Dutchman as they consider their options in defence. With the futures of Renato Veiga and Ben Chilwell looking to be away from Stamford Bridge, Chelsea will be without a natural left-back support option for Marc Cucurella.<br><br>Ishe Samuels-Smith could have been that man but he is set to leave Chelsea this summer as well. Whether that is on loan or on a permanent basis remains to be seen, with Strasbourg, the Blues' sister club, interested in signing the 19-year-old defender. Talks are well under way over Samuels-Smith moving to Stade de la Meinau.<br><br>Chelsea want at least Â£8million - double the amount the Blues paid Everton for the teenager's signature back in 2023 - for Samuels-Smith, football.london understands. Samuels-Smith's entourage have been in France now for over a week discussing a potential deal for the defender, although he is is yet to give the green light himself.<br><br>Sources close to the player have told football.london that his camp are expecting an offer from Strasbourg this week and it will then be up to Samuels-Smith to decide whether he wants to relocate and embark on a new chapter in his career. Once Samuels-Smith has given the go-ahead, Chelsea and Strasbourg will then continue talks over a fee and the structure of the deal.<br><br>Chelsea are FIFA Club World Cup champions. To celebrate, the club has launched a new collection with t-shirts, hoodies and more, including the 2025/26 Home Shirt with 'World Champions 25' printing.<br><br>Elsewhere, there is set to be plenty more business between Chelsea and the BlueCo-owned French outfit in the coming weeks. Already Mathis Amougou has moved there on a permanent basis, but there is expected to be some loan deals conducted very soon.<br><br>Mike Penders is set to spend the season working under Liam Rosenior. The 19-year-old goalkeeper arrived from Genk this summer and was part of the 28-man squad for the recently-concluded Club World Cup, but the Blues believe his time would be best suited elsewhere in order for the Belgian shot-stopper to gain more first-team experience.<br><br>Kendry Paez is in a similar boat as well. Arriving from Ecuador this summer, opportunities in the first team would likely be limited for the 18-year-old next season. Strasbourg are set to sign Paez on a season-long loan deal, football.london understands, and will be hoping the Ecuador international can produce similar to what Andrey Santos did during his time there last term.<br><br>Aaron Anselmino may also be on his way out of Chelsea on a temporary basis. Strasbourg are interested in signing the Argentine defender, who was recalled from his loan at Boca Juniors in January but has only played once for the first team - a late cameo in the Club World Cup victory over Benfica last month.</div></body></html>
