A senior football journalist, Theo joined the ECHO's sports team from Bolton Wanderers in 2018, having previously spent four seasons in the former Premier League side's communications team where he ran the club's website and social media channels. <br>A regular in the Anfield press box since joining the ECHO, since being promoted to Liverpool FC Writer, Theo has reported on Jurgen Klopp's side as they won the FA Cup and League Cup at Wembley, and competed in the 2022 Champions League final in Paris. A regular on the Blood Red podcast, Theo has also conducted a number of exclusive interviews during his time with the ECHO, speaking to the likes of Roger Hunt, Nicolas Anelka, and Alberto Aquilani.<br><br>The last time Liverpool took to the field, with it already confirmed that Trent Alexander-Arnold would be leaving for pastures new, Conor Bradley was substituted at half-time. The Northern Ireland international started the Reds’ three final matches of the season, after their vice-captain’s exit decision had been confirmed.<br><br>But while he had claimed an impressive assist in the penultimate game of the season against Brighton & Hove Albion, he ultimately struggled against Crystal Palace on the final day.<br><br>At fault for the Eagles’ goal, he was withdrawn at half-time in favour of Alexander-Arnold as Slot sent Liverpool out to rescue the game - with the champions trailing 1-0 and down to 10 men after Ryan Gravenberch was sent off.<br><br>Liverpool wasted no time signing a new right-back following the end of the season as they activated Jeremie Frimpong’s £29.5m release clause.<br><br>But just because the Reds have a new big-money right-back, that does not mean Bradley will be giving up his place without a fight.<br><br>The Northern Ireland international was one of Liverpool’s star performers in the first half of their pre-season friendly win over Preston North End, on a day that will be remembered for the tributes paid to Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva.<br><br>It was the 22-year-old who opened the scoring, side-footing home across goal at the far post following smart work from Rio Ngumoha and Federico Chiesa, before subtly looking to the sky in memory of Jota.<br><br>Yet his most memorable involvement came at the other end when seeing out the ball under pressure from Thierry Small to stop a threatening Preston attack in its tracks.<br><br>The Liverpool supporters had been singing Jota’s popular chant on loop for 10 minutes up to that point, only to be interrupted by Bradley’s defensive contribution. Bursting into roars and cheers, a rendition of ‘There’s only one Conor Bradley’ then rang out.<br><br>Frimpong was lively enough himself when he came on for his unofficial debut at half-time in place of Bradley, as were both Kostas Tsimikas and fellow debutant Milos Kerkez on the other flank.<br><br>But while Liverpool have spent big at full-back this summer, first-choice status is still very much up for grabs.<br><br>And it would be little surprise if the Reds were to actually start with a right-back who cost them nothing at all when their Premier League campaign gets underway next month.<br><br>Chiesa given chance after Slot challenge<br><br>Towards the back-end of last season, Arne Slot challenged Federico Chiesa to make the most of pre-season ahead of the new campaign after a year on the fringes at Anfield.<br><br>While the Italian admitted earlier this summer he would be open to a return to Italy, his future remains uncertain.<br><br>But he was given the nod up front here against Preston by Slot as the Dutchman gave him an early opportunity to hit the ground running.<br><br>Much like his full Premier League debut at Brighton, the Italy international was bullied at times down the middle during the opening moments. But he did grow into the game as the half wore on, before being withdrawn at half-time as Slot changed his entire XI.<br><br>At one point, he looked to race clear of the defence and run through on goal, only to be forced wide. Still, he recovered possession in the box, only to curl just wide.<br><br>Yet the opening goal did come following smart play from Chiesa. Receiving possession from Rio Ngumoha in the box, he burst past one defender before firing in a low cross that was fired in by Conor Bradley, via a touch en route from Dominik Szoboslzai.<br><br>Chiesa’s future remains undecided with talk of overseas interest having gone quiet in recent weeks.<br><br>But having been left playing catch-up last season, joining the Reds after being frozen out by Juventus, this was a positive start to the summer for the Italian.<br><br>Rio Ngumoha is still only 16 years old. Signed on scholarship terms last summer, he won’t sign his first professional contract with Liverpool until after his 17th birthday next month.<br><br>But you can see why the teenager is so highly rated at Anfield after he caught the eye in the first half against Preston North End.<br><br>Time and time again, with the ball at his feet, he got the better of Pol Valentin when running at the wing-back down the Reds’ left-hand side.<br><br>He was unfortunate not to open the scoring with one piece of smart play, as he cut inside and evaded multiple challenges, only to see his shot deflected just wide.<br><br>But he did play a hand in the opening goal with more smart feet, jinking away from defenders before feeding Federico Chiesa.<br><br>The teenager was limited to ‘just’ a Liverpool debut against Accrington Stanley last season. But set to get a full senior pre-season under his belt, expect the young forward to feature a little more prominently in the new campaign.<br><br>He was not the only one, of course. Trey Nyoni also impressed in a deeper midfield role. The 18-year-old might still be gangly in frame, but he was far from bullied in the engine-room against physical Championship opposition.<br><br>Never afraid to get stuck in, he won the ball back multiple times and showed great discipline to cover for his defensive team-mates across the pitch when they burst forward.<br><br>Luca Stephenson impressed also, lining up out of position at centre-back, while Ben Doak marked his return from injury with an assist off the bench for Cody Gakpo after doing well to steal possession.<br><br>With no senior international tournament taking place this summer, Slot has almost his entire first team squad available to him in pre-season. But that has not stopped a number of the young guns from making an early impression.</div></body></html>
