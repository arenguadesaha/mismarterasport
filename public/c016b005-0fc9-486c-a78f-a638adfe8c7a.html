However, behind the scenes, there is still plenty of work being done in order to get Enzo Maresca's squad in the best possible shape ahead of the new season.<br><br>Chelsea take on Crystal Palace in their opening fixture of the season, with the Eagles coming to Stamford Bridge on August 17. Before that, the Blues will be looking to build the perfect 25-man squad in the summer transfer window.<br><br>The west Londoners will be required to submit theirs before tomorrow's game. In the squad, no more than 17 overseas players can be named, while the remaining eight spots have to go to homegrown players.<br><br>As per regulations, to be considered homegrown, players need to have been registered with any club affiliated to the Football Association or the Welsh FA for a period, continuous or not, of three entire seasons, or 36 months, before his 21st birthday (or the end of the season during which he turns 21).<br><br>Premier League rules state: "An Under 21 player is defined as one who is under the age of 21 on 1st January in the year in which the season commences and are eligible over and above the limit of 25 players per squad. As a result, for the 2023/24 campaign, Under-21 players will have been born on or after 1 January 2002."<br><br>As far as the goalkeeper situation goes, it may well be very similar to what Chelsea have at their disposal at the time of writing. Robert Sanchez impressed towards the end of last season and sources tell football.london the club retain full belief in the Spaniard.<br><br>Mike Penders is very much one for the future at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea, however, are set to loan the 19-year-old goalkeeper out this summer with Strasbourg interested in bringing him in to replace Djordje Petrovic. Gabriel Slonina could stick around to be the third-choice goalkeeper following the departure of Marcus Bettinelli.<br><br>Chelsea are FIFA Club World Cup champions. To celebrate, the club has launched a new collection with t-shirts, hoodies and more, including the 2025/26 Home Shirt with 'World Champions 25' printing.<br><br>Chelsea are in the market for a new defender and Jorrel Hato is someone the club are considering making a move for, football.london understands. The 19-year-old can play as a left-back and in the centre of defence - something that appeals to the Blues given the lack of cover for Marc Cucurella.<br><br>Meanwhile, Andrey Santos and Dario Essugo are expected to stick around for the upcoming season to provide support and cover for the likes of Romeo Lavia, Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall is free to leave should the right offer come in for the 26-year-old, though Chelsea are not in a desperate rush to sell the midfielder, who contributed in the club's impressive 2024/25 season.<br><br>Chelsea have already added three attacking players this summer. Jamie Gittens, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap have all been brought in to bolster Maresca's options, although Noni Madueke and Jadon Sancho have both departed. Another winger could be brought in but at this point, there is nothing advanced on that front.<br><br>Christopher Nkunku is still expected to be sold by Chelsea despite impressing for the Blues in the Club World Cup. Outcasts such as Raheem Sterling, Joao Felix and Armando Broja are expected to depart, while Marc Guiu is set to leave on loan.<br><br>So, with all that in mind, football.london takes a look at the 'dream' 25-man squad for Chelsea to register for the upcoming Premier League season.<br><br>Goalkeepers: Robert Sanchez (HG), Filip Jorgensen, Gabriel Slonina<br><br>Defenders: Levi Colwill (HG), Reece James (HG), Wesley Fofana, Tosin Adarabioyo (HG), Trevoh Chalobah (HG), Benoit Badiashile, Marc Cucurella, Malo Gusto<br><br>Midfielders: Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (HG)<br><br>Attackers: Joao Pedro (HG), Pedro Neto, Liam Delap (HG), Nicolas Jackson, Cole Palmer (HG)<br><br>U21 players: Jamie Gittens, Estevao Willian, Romeo Lavia, Tyrique George, Josh Acheampong, Andrey Santos, Dario Essugo, Jorrel Hato</div></body></html>
