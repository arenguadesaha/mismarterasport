          <h1>Luis Diaz offers update on Liverpool future as fresh Bayern Munich transfer links emerge - 'We're talking'</h1>
          <div>Luis Diaz has admitted he does not know where his future lies as he continues to be linked with a Liverpool exit. The Reds have already rejected approaches from both Barcelona and Bayern Munich for the Colombian so far this summer.<br><br>But that has not stopped the 28-year-old from continually being linked with an Anfield exit as his future remains the subject of scrutiny and speculation.<br><br>Recent reports in Germany claim that the forward, who scored 17 goals for Premier League champions Liverpool last year, is keen on a move to Bayern, while it has also been suggested the Bavarians have made an official bid for Diaz. Meanwhile, his affection for Barcelona is also well known.<br><br>However, the Reds have remained adamant that the 28-year-old is not for sale. With two years left on his current deal, the Premier League champions are relaxed about Diaz's situation, although the forward is keen to discuss an improvement on his current terms.<br><br>The Colombia international has spoken a number of times about his future in recent weeks.<br><br>And he’s not confirmed that his future remains uncertain amid ongoing talks with club bosses.<br><br>“We don’t know yet,” he told Win Sports when asked where his future lies. “Nothing, nothing (to say).<br><br>“We’re there talking with the management, we’re calm where I am. So nothing (to say), we’re talking about matters.”<br><br>Diaz had earlier insisted that he was happy at Liverpool despite the ongoing speculation, though he stopped short of committing his future to the club.<br><br>He told Colombian influencer Mauricio Gomez: "We’re there, negotiating. We’ll see what can be achieved, for us and for the club. We’ll try to do our best and make the best decision."<br><br>Pushed on interest from Saudi side Al-Nassr, he added: "We’re in the process of negotiations, talking with the club, with Liverpool, with everyone who’s approaching us. But I’m very calm where I am, you know, very happy. Trying to make the best decision now."<br><br>Meanwhile, Diaz has previously admitted on international duty last month that he was in talks with other clubs and his future was in Liverpool’s hands.<br><br>"We are currently in contact with Liverpool, because we are talking to clubs, and that’s normal given the transfer market that’s opening. We’re trying to arrange what’s best for us.<br><br>“We’re talking to clubs, it’s normal in the market and we’re looking at what’s best for us. I’m waiting to see what happens.<br><br>“I’m very happy at Liverpool, I’ve always said so. They’ve welcomed me very well from day one. If they give us a good renewal or I stay there for two years, I’ll be happy. Now it’s up to them.”</div>
