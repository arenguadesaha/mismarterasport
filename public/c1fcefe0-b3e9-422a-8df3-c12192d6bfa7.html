He came to the attention of City with a prolific youth record for West Ham and made his first-team bow for the Blues last season.<br><br>Signed for £2million last August, he scored on his debut against Salford City in the FA Cup and made his first Premier League appearance for the club when he got 27 minutes off the bench against Ipswich.<br><br>Now, he has the chance to impress on a weekly basis, and Robins has challenged him to make a name for himself. He backed his 'raw talent' to come to the front after explaining how pleased he was to land the striker.<br><br>"I’m honestly delighted to have him because there’s a player there who, for all intents and purposes, is a little bit untried and untested and he’s 20 years of age," said Robins.<br><br>“He’s broken into the West Ham team before he moved to Manchester City and he’s scored a few goals, but obviously to break in and have a break out season in the Premier League is really difficult to do, especially when you’re at certain clubs and they’ve got to get certain results.<br><br>“But he’s started to come through and he was recognised by Man City really early, and then it’s really interesting what players do.<br><br>“Some players can feel their way but then Man City comes and it’s a massive club with a lot of history behind them now in terms of winning with Pep Guardiola at the head of that, and it’s difficult to turn that down.<br><br>"He’s obviously moved there and wanted to try to prove himself. I think he’s signed a five-year contract there so he’s got plenty of time to try to come through.<br><br>“He’s got raw talent, real raw talent, and he’s a really nice kid. I think he’ll be really popular with our supporters. He’s got a good sense of humour and a big smile on his face all the time. He’s serious about what he wants to do and his work but he’s a dream to have to be honest.<br><br>“He’s got a lot of attributes that are going to help us this season and hopefully it will gain him some real notoriety in a positive way.”<br><br>Kevin de Bruyne is one of - if not the - greatest players to play for Manchester City.<br><br>He leaves the club having won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, five League Cups and a memorable Champions League victory!<br><br>To mark his amazing time at the Etihad Stadium, this special edition has been produced - KDB The King - to celebrate Kev's career with the Blues.
