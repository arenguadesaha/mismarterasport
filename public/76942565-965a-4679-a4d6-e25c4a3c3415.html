Yet even after winning the FIFA Club World Cup, there are areas of the squad that need improving ahead of the upcoming season.<br><br>The Blues have already strengthened their squad plenty this summer. Jamie Gittens, Joao Pedro, Liam Delap, Estevao Willian, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez have all already been brought in for an accumulated figure of around £211million. That could go past the £250million-mark should Chelsea move for Ajax defender Jorrel Hato, who has emerged as a big target for the Blues.<br><br>Marc Cucurella is the go-to left-back at Stamford Bridge at the time of writing after the Spaniard produced wonderful form throughout the 2024/25 season. However, there is little cover for the Spain international with both Ben Chilwell and Renato Veiga expected to depart over the course of the summer window.<br><br>Malo Gusto and Reece James can both play on the left-hand side of defence, though they are natural right-backs. So bringing in someone like Hato, who can also be used in the centre of defence, is an attractive option for Chelsea. football.london understands the Blues are considering making a move for the Ajax teenager.<br><br>At the moment, that seems like the most glaring problem in the Chelsea squad. In the centre of defence, there are the likes of Wesley Fofana, Levi Colwill, Benoit Badiashile, Trevoh Chalobah and Tosin Adarabioyo. Chalobah's future remains uncertain but the Blues will be encouraged by a strong Club World Cup campaign from the Cobham graduate in the US.<br><br>Chelsea are FIFA Club World Cup champions. To celebrate, the club has launched a new collection with t-shirts, hoodies and more, including the 2025/26 Home Shirt with 'World Champions 25' printing.<br><br>In midfield, Chelsea will have Andrey Santos and Essugo to add depth for the likes of Enzo Fernandez, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia. In attack, Joao Pedro, Gittens, Estevao and Delap have all been signed, while Noni Madueke has been sold to Arsenal and Christopher Nkunku remains on the transfer list.<br><br>Nkunku impressed at times during the Club World Cup but the Frenchman remains open to leaving Stamford Bridge. Signed for £52million in the summer of 2023, Nkunku has had a difficult time in west London but remains hot property on the market.<br><br>football.london understands Bayern Munich remain keen on the French forward, although nothing is advanced at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the likes of Marc Guiu, Raheem Sterling, Joao Felix and Armando Broja are all expected to leave. Albeit, Guiu is expected to be on a loan deal.<br><br>Paez, who arrived at Chelsea this summer, was not included in Enzo Maresca's 28-man squad for the Club World Cup and is expected to leave on loan. Strasbourg, owned by BlueCo, are interested in signing the Ecuador international on a temporary deal, with Mike Penders and Aaron Anselmino also expected to switch west London for east France.</div></body></html>
