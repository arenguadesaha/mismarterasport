He previously also covered Everton for 18 years and followed England, reporting on the European Championships and World Cup final. Once had to tell Jude Law he does not drive a Mini.<br><br>The tributes on an emotional occasion had already moved many inside Deepdale to tears. And when the clock ticked over into the 20th minute, Liverpool supporters made it abundantly clear just how much Diogo Jota will forever mean to them.<br><br>The trademark song in salute of the Portuguese had already been aired on several occasions before and during the game. This, though, was different, a chant that grew both in volume and feeling with each repeated airing from the 6,000 Reds gathered, rather appropriately, in the Bill Shankly Stand.<br><br>After a brief period, the home supporters and even some in the press box – including former Liverpool players Jason McAteer and Jay Spearing – joined in the applause that resonated far, far beyond those inside the stadium.<br><br>It continued for almost 10 minutes before being halted by defiant cheers prompted by an enthusiastic piece of defending in front of the travelling Kop by Conor Bradley to fend off Preston North End winger and former Everton man Thierry Small.<br><br>This was always destined to be an afternoon laced with significance. When Liverpool’s opening pre-season friendly was confirmed earlier in the summer, the date was swiftly circled by the travelling Kop as a first opportunity to celebrate number 20.<br><br>Recent tragic events, though, meant it wasn’t just a record-equalling championship that was being marked but the passing of one of the players who ensured Liverpool’s second Premier League title in six seasons after Jota and his brother Andre Silva were killed in a car crash in Spain earlier this month.<br><br>Before the game, Preston captain Ben Whiteman laid a wreath in front of the away end before Claudia Rose Maguire, wife of former Preston player Sean, performed moving renditions of home favourite Can’t Help Falling In Love and Liverpool anthem You’ll Never Walk Alone.<br><br>If inevitably laced with sadness, there was a real sense throughout the match of Reds supporters being intent on honouring Jota and make clear to the family and friends of the late Portuguese of the genuine affection with which he has always been held among the fanbase.<br><br>That became evident after the final whistle. With the image of Jota and his brother Andre Silva once again shown on the screen inside Deepdale, the away end, applauded by the gathered Liverpool players and coaching staff, once again saluted their Premier League winner.<br><br>An emotional moment of togetherness that lasted more than five minutes, it was brought to a conclusion when Reds fans broke into a chant of “Champions” followed by “Liverpool, Liverpool”. The embraces shared by several players spoke volumes.<br><br>This was always going to be a difficult, intense afternoon for a Reds squad whose close relationships were key to their triumphs under previous boss Jurgen Klopp and now Arne Slot. With a tour to the Far East imminent followed by games at Anfield and Wembley next month, there will be more to come. A return to what could loosely be deemed normality remains some way off.<br><br>There is no training, no guidebook for how best to deal with the grief of losing a valued team-mate and paying tribute to his passing while also embracing the reality of a job still needing to be done. Liverpool's defence of their Premier League crown will begin as scheduled at home to Bournemouth in less than five weeks.<br><br>Their players, backroom staff and the club in general therefore deserve credit for the manner in which they continue to respond to such a tragic and unparalleled situation. What has shone brightest is their humanity.<br><br>Understandably, the Reds were without a number of senior players at Preston, due to both the emotional toll of the last week and the obvious disruption caused to the regular pre-season schedule.<br><br>No risks were taken over the fitness of the squad, which meant club record £116million signing Florian Wirtz, skipper Virgil van Dijk, centre-back Ibrahima Konate and winger Luis Diaz were among those not involved.<br><br>Those who played applied themselves admirably, with Reds boss Slot selecting two completely different line-ups for each half.<br><br>Georgia international goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili was the only new signing to start the game and had little to do as Liverpool, with 16-year-old left winger Rio Ngumoha impressing, were the dominant team and took the lead on 33 minutes.<br><br>Not for the first time, Ngumoha wriggled his way beyond defenders inside the area before Federico Chiesa took on possession and put the ball across goal, with Dominik Szoboszlai’s attempted shot becoming an assist for Bradley to sweep home at the far post.<br><br>Pre-season will be an important period for Bradley as he looks to become a more regular starter at right-back with Trent Alexander-Arnold now gone. He was replaced at the break by new arrival Jeremie Frimpong, who was quietly assured if less spectacular, similar to Milos Kerkez in the other full-back role.<br><br>Darwin Nunez pounced on a poor Jordan Storey backpass to score Liverpool’s second on 53 minutes before replicating Jota’s trademark Baby Shark and PlayStation celebrations.<br><br>And after Liam Lindsay pulled a goal back for Preston with a powerful header from a corner, Cody Gakpo completed the scoring two minutes from time by sweeping home after Ben Doak won possession on the right and put in a low cross cleverly dummied by Nunez.<br><br>Then came the stirring scenes at the final whistle. It served as a reminder that Diogo Jota – as Slot said before the game, a champion in every aspect of his life – will never, ever be forgotten.</div></body></html>
