Deepdale, though, proved a showcase for both the potential next generation and possible transfer income for the Reds.<br><br>With a number of senior players understandably not involved, whether for emotional or fitness reasons after a disrupted start to pre-season preparations, the door was left open for a number of youngsters to be given an opportunity.<br><br>All bar Luca Stephenson, who spent last season as a first-team regular on loan at Scottish Premiership side Dundee United, had previous competitive first-team experience with Liverpool.<br><br>The standouts were among the starters, with 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha the stellar performer. As well as playing a part in the opening goal, the winger - who doesn't turn 17 until next month - impressed with his pace, close control, dribbling and, most importantly, his decision-making.<br><br>Both he and 18-year-old Trey Nyoni, solid at the base of the midfield alongside Ryan Gravenberch, appear to have developed physically this year. Given the duo have been training regularly with the first team, it seems most likely they will stay at Kirkby for the foreseeable rather than be loaned out.<br><br>Stephenson demonstrated his versatility by slotting in confidently at centre-back with Joe Gomez, and the 21-year-old has evidently benefited from consistent first-team exposure in Scotland. The midfielder has one year remaining on his contract at Anfield, with Dundee United having previously expressed an interest in signing him on a permanent deal.<br><br>Ben Doak was the most high-profile youngster on display and one of three who featured in the second half. Doak, still only 19 and who assisted Liverpool's third goal at Preston for Cody Gakpo, had an impressive loan at Championship side Middlesbrough last term cut short by injury, and was the subject of failed interest from Crystal Palace and Ipswich Town in January.<br><br>A permanent exit appears likely given the desire of the player for regular minutes. Nottingham Forest are the latest among several Premier League and overseas clubs to show an interest, with Liverpool expected to demand at least Â£25m for the Scotland international.<br><br>Lewis Koumas, the 19-year-old attacker, spent last season at Stoke City and is already being courted by a number of Championship clubs, with another loan move possible. But the development of 18-year-old centre-back Amara Nallo's would seem best served with the under-21s for the time being.<br><br>Then there are the more prominent youngsters who weren't involved.<br><br>After an injury-hit previous campaign that scuppered a loan move to Sunderland in the New Year, Jayden Danns was pictured in first-team training on Tuesday and could be primed to finally make a temporary switch.<br><br>James McConnell is back available after his previous campaign was ended early by injury and is another for whom a loan move, either to the Championship or a lower Premier League club, would be of benefit. Indeed, Liverpool could be tempted by a permanent offer.<br><br>Decisions will also be taken on left-backs Luke Chambers and Owen Beck and winger Kaide Gordon, who had contrasting experiences on loan last term. Another left-sided defender, Calum Scanlon, continues to recover from a hamstring injury.<br><br>With no international tournaments this summer and a full senior squad available for the forthcoming tour to the Far East, only a limited number of Academy players will travel with the first team.<br><br>Ngumoha, Nyoni and Stephenson did their hopes no harm in that regard at the weekend, and a greater idea of the expected road map for many youngsters will emerge from the squad selected by Arne Slot for the games in Hong Kong and Japan.<br><br>The best course of development will be the primary consideration for players without the first-team experience of some of their fellow youngsters. Otherwise, much will depend on the opportunities this season and beyond that individual players should expect at Liverpool.<br><br>And should some be moved on, it would show how the Academy can indirectly benefit the first team by raising funds for squad reinforcements. It will provide another sub-plot to an increasingly intriguing transfer window for Liverpool.</div></body></html>
