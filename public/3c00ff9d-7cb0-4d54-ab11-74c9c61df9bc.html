The Blues will bank £11.2m for the midfielder with the potential for a small rise to £13m after Como negotiated to land the player on a permanent deal.<br><br>The money will be welcomed by City to help their overall net spend in a year where they have spent £275m already, adding to the funds they have already taken in this summer. However, the club will be disappointed to have come to such a fee after they expected Como to pay £25m (€30m) following initial discussions over a transfer.<br><br>Perrone had impressed in Serie A as Cesc Fabregas's side comfortably secured their mid-table place in the Italian top division. They are looking to build on that next year after Fabregas dismissed speculation he could leave to continue leading the team.<br><br>The 22-year-old Perrone will continue to be part of that and Como will be delighted at having secured a bargain fee. He will link up with his teammates when they return for pre-season, having not been part of Pep Guardiola's squad for the Club World Cup.<br><br>City have negotiated a chunky sell-on into the deal, which could see them earn more millions if the Argentine secures a big move in future. They have previously benefitted from similar clauses in transfers, with Romeo Lavia and Jadon Sancho earning them over £20m when they moved clubs.<br><br>The Blues would relish any extra money they can make, having only made £3m in profit on a player they signed in 2023. Perrone made appearances in the FA Cup and Premier League before heading out on loan for the past two seasons.<br><br>The rest of the summer will mostly focus on departures after City brought in most of their new signings in time for the Club World Cup. Rayan Cherki, Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli all arrived in the first transfer window that allowed signings to be made in time for the US tournament.<br><br>Club captain Kyle Walker has since departed for Burnley in a move that could be worth £15m to City, and Jack Grealish will likely be the most high-profile exit over the next few months. There will be some surprises though in a squad that Guardiola said is too big despite everyone in it wanting to stay.<br><br>Hugo Viana is taking charge of his first summer as sporting director at the club, having joined from Portuguese club Sporting. He replaced long-serving Txiki Begiristain, who left after the Club World Cup after 13 years at the Etihad.<br><br>Viana is tasked with getting City back to the top of English football after standards slipped last season.<br><br>Here at the Manchester Evening News, we’re dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester City coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don’t miss out on the latest City news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
