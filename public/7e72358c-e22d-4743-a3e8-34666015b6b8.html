United had hoped to sell Jadon Sancho to Chelsea but the Club World Cup winners paid a Â£5million penalty fee not to make his loan move a permanent deal.<br><br>United have been renowned for producing world-class wingers for most of their history but Amorim is wedded to a 3-4-2-1 formation and did not feel Rashford or Garnacho were defensively disciplined enough to occupy either of the wide roles.<br><br>Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.<br><br>The United co-owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, said last year the club would decide on what system the manager would play yet United have reneged on that pledge with Amorim, who replaced Erik ten Hag as permanent manager in November.<br><br>United are confident of signing Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo to offset the possible departures of four wingers and reinforce their right-hand side.<br><br>Well-placed sources have reiterated United are targeting players who can play in multiple formations, rather than those who function in a back three. Mbeumo has played on the wing, up front and at wing back for Brentford.<br><br>Matheus Cunha spent his final months at Wolves operating in a 3-4-2-1 formation but he also played up front and as the sole playmaker before Vitor Pereira took over as manager in December.<br><br>Rashford, Garnacho, Antony, Sancho and left back Tyrell Malacia arrived at United's Carrington training complex on Wednesday just before Amorim left. The quintet are not training with the first team amid their wish to leave.<br><br>Sancho's representatives have held discussions with Italian clubs, Antony is prepared to take a pay cut, Rashford would favour a move abroad and Garnacho has been linked with Chelsea.</div></body></html>
