It is claimed a contract agreement is already in place with the Cameroonian and, if this is the case, only a medical and some more formalities stand between United and their man.<br><br>This negotiation process has been the bane of United for most of the summer transfer window. While their rivals have completed deals swiftly, the Reds have been locked in negotiations with seemingly no end goal in sight.<br><br>Now there is light at the end of the tunnel, the question remains how will United utilise their £70m man. The obvious gamble with this situation is that Mbeumo has been mainly utilised as a right-sided winger.<br><br>Thomas Frank did play him as a right wing-back on rare occasions but clearly positioning him there would be a waste of his talents. The general consensus is that Mbeumo will be played in one of the two No.10 positions.<br><br>He has experience playing more centrally and could perhaps fill that half position between the No.10 and wing to provide United with a new outlet to exploit. But, could Ruben Amorim be about to pull off the ultimate gamble instead and sign Mbeumo to be the Reds' new centre-forward?<br><br>At the start of the window, the two priorities were attacking midfielder Matheus Cunha and striker Liam Delap. United manage to sign the former but missed out on the latter to Chelsea.<br><br>With Delap off the table, United quickly moved to focus their attention on Mbeumo. It might be trivial to presume this would be a like-for-like switch but no other centre-forward has been firmly linked with the Reds.<br><br>If this is Amorim's masterplan, it is a huge gamble. While Mbeumo has that much sort after skill of being versatile, United could easily have spent £70m on a player who is a natural striker.<br><br>Both Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen have been available for less or similar amounts of money this summer. They may not have been as young and as versatile as Mbeumo but they would be considered a less risky choice.<br><br>This could all be speculation but splashing £132.5m on two No.10s when there is no Champions League money on the horizon this season and the club is desperate for a centre-forward, is an unorthodox call. However, that theory pales in comparison to the idea that Mbeumo has been signed to predominantly play as the club's new striker; this is the sort of risk that could show Amorim to be a genius.<br><br>Here at The Manchester Evening News, we are dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don't miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
