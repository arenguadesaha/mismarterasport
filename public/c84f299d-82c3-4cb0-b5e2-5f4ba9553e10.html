The news follows the opening three signings of the summer: Kepa Arrizabalaga, signed for his cheap £5million release clause, Martin Zubimendi, signed by paying slightly more than his £51million release clause on more favourable terms, and Christian Norgaard who joined for just north of £10million.<br><br>Mosquera comes in to add the depth that was missing on the right-hand side of the defence. While Jakub Kiwior had offered depth to Gabriel Magalhaes with both Myles Lewis-Skelly and Riccardo Calafiori options at left-back, William Saliba had no one.<br><br>Both Ben White and Jurrien Timber, the two options at right-back, could offer some depth. They have also suffered persistent fitness issues, which have seen three procedures carried out on the pair in less than two years.<br><br>Mosquera can play in either of the two centre-half positions but has deputised at right-back. His athleticism, speed and strength make him a comfortable fit for the role.<br><br>While it is unlikely he will be able to break into the team initially with the presence of such high-profile players ahead of him, there will be chances for rotation and because injury has plagued the Arsenal side so much, there is sure to be both opportunity and a consciousness from Mikel Arteta to be more open to rotation and earlier changes in matches. Mosquera has been very determined to make the deal happen.<br><br>He turned down multiple contract offers from Valencia, which would have made him one of the highest-paid members at the club. However, his desire to join the north London side, aided by conversations with the likes of Arteta, has proven more than enough to make this deal progress.<br><br>He will have his medical in London this week before completing media duties, following the same path as Noni Madueke who completed his medical on Monday afternoon following an agreement of £48.5million and £3.5million in add-ons with Chelsea. Arteta wants him signed up and on the plane to Asia, departing July 19. He could make his debut for the club four days later against AC Milan.<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
