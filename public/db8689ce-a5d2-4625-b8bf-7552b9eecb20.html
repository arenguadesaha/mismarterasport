Simons registered 19 goal contributions last campaign, adding to the reputation he built two seasons earlier when he scored 22 goals for PSV Eindhoven.<br><br>football.london reported last month that Simons was on Chelsea’s radar, and now Spanish outlet Sport claims the Blues have held talks with the player’s representatives over a potential move.<br><br>But it isn’t just Enzo Maresca’s side in the race. The report goes on to add that Man United and Bayern are also exploring a deal, with United also having held discussions with Simons’ entourage. Arsenal have also been tentatively linked.<br><br>The good news for all interested parties is that Simons has reportedly informed his club of his desire to leave. No official bids have been made so far, largely due to the Dutchman's steep asking price.<br><br>Reports suggest Simons could cost anywhere between £52million and £60million. Premier League clubs have already spent a combined total of £1billion this summer, with both Chelsea and United surpassing the £100million mark individually.<br><br>With budgets already stretched, a move for Simons would likely require absolute certainty that he is the right fit, especially with Chelsea and United having already bolstered their attacking options.<br><br>The Netherlands international has also been linked with a return to Barcelona, where he spent nine years in the youth ranks before moving to Paris Saint-Germain.<br><br>A move to Bayern could be the most straightforward option for Simons, as he would not need to switch countries. However, he wouldn’t be guaranteed a starting spot in Vincent Kompany’s already talent-packed squad.<br><br>Simons addressed his future earlier this year, saying: “I’m still a young player, I have many dreams and the club knows that. But right now, the most important thing for me is to play well in the upcoming games.”<br><br>Want to keep up to date with the breaking and important Chelsea stories whilst on the move?
