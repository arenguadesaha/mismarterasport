The club are set to play three matches abroad for their fans in the East with clashes against AC Milan, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur scheduled.<br><br>The Gunners’ manager Mikel Arteta will get a first look at some of his new signings and their impact on the team. While some have already joined some remain in the balance and awaiting confirmation.<br><br>Noni Madueke will be granted an extended break, meanwhile, and the England international might not feature on the tour but could join later. With all that in mind, football.london runs through a dream scenario for the Gunners while playing in Asia.<br><br>The signing everyone has been waiting for is the Swedish international Viktor Gyokeres who remains very much in the minds of the club as they try and tie-off a deal for the striker. A fee has been agreed in principle and the final details are being worked out as we await official confirmation.<br><br>While he might miss the squad’s flight out, although the club are working in the hope that will not happen, he could yet join up slightly later and then make his debut. Gyokeres has been staying fit while not training with Sporting CP, getting himself ready for the move to the club of his dreams where he could then make that fabled debut.<br><br>Arsenal are hopeful of still doing some business between now and the end of the window with the one player who could yet join being Eberechi Eze. Fans will remember that despite coming along to the American tour, Emile Smith Rowe was left out as he eventually made his move to Fulham in the summer.<br><br>Should Arsenal find the agreement with Crystal Palace for Eze or decide to activate the player’s release clause, a reverse event could take place. It might be that this deal happens later in the month, but there is a chance in a certain dream world that Eze joins the side while they are in Asia.<br><br>One of the best things about pre-season is the opportunity to assess the talent coming through the ranks as they make their own appearances with the senior side. Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly used last summer to propel their careers before making breakthroughs midway through the campaign.<br><br>Max Dowman is of course the name most supporters are keenest to see. But others like Marli Salmon and Andre Harriman-Annous could yet get chances as well after joining the team in their La Manga warm weather training camp.<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
