They have already added three players in the form of Martin Zubimendi, Kepa Arrizabalaga and Christian Norgaard with three more close to completion.<br><br>Noni Madueke and Cristhian Mosquera are expected to be announced soon, while a move for Viktor Gyokeres remains at an advanced stage, with the final details of the transfer being sorted. Six additions to this squad are significant for Arteta and certainly better equip the team ahead of another title race.<br><br>However, many want to see more reinforcement and a potential seventh or even eighth addition made. Eberechi Eze remains high on the club’s list, and should they succeed in moving on some of their fringe players like Fabio Vieira and Oleksandr Zinchenko, this will certainly help in making a move.<br><br>Yet, the name of Rodrygo has continued to appear throughout the window with many pining to see the Brazilian join the club from Real Madrid this summer. While the winger would represent quite the coup by the club, the likelihood of a move remains lower down the list of probabilities.<br><br>The reason being is while both Gyokeres and Madueke coming in fill empty spots in the striker and right wing rosters, the left hand side already has two players occupying the roles. Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard both remain at the club and unless that changes a move for Rodrygo was always unlikely.<br><br>Both have been linked with exits, Trossard appearing the most likely with a £20million price-tag thought to be attached to the player who football.london understands also to be in discussions with Arsenal over new terms of a contract which would see him stay. While the likes of Bayern Munich have been mentioned in links to the Belgian however, nothing has so far happened.<br><br>Andrea Berta's next focus this summer after the deals for Mosquera, Madueke and Gyokeres are completed is to focus on outgoings. Reiss Nelson is linked with a loan to Fulham while interest in others is expected to develop later.<br><br>In addition, Eze’s ability to play in the wide area should he sign means the acquisition of both the England international and Rodrygo would still be unlikely even if Trossard was sold. Perhaps if the much more expensive Martinelli found a suitor this could change things but until then the three attacking aims of Arsenal - Gyokeres, Madueke and Eze - appear where the recruitment might end.<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
