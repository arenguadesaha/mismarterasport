Where their differences currently need to solved is in how this figure will be structured in payments and add-ons.<br><br>Meanwhile the fact the Swedish star won't return to Portugal has been heavily reported on. Gyokeres has not reported for pre-season training whilst Arsenal hash out a transfer, leading Sporting's president, Frederico Varandas, to threaten disciplinary charges against his own player.<br><br>"We're calm. Everything will be resolved with the closing of the market, a heavy fine, and an apology to the group," Varandas said to Lusa news agency. "If they (interested clubs) don't want to pay fair market value for Viktor, we are very comfortable with that for the next three years."<br><br>"If the geniuses who are devising this strategy think that this puts pressure on me to facilitate the exit, they are not only completely wrong but are also making the player's exit even more complicated.
