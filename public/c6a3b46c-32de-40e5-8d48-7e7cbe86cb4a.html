City will follow his development with interest.<br><br>They have become masters at inserting sell-on clauses in deals to sell academy youngsters and then making further profit on their sales later.<br><br>James Trafford will become the latest example when he completes his likely move from Burnley to Newcastle. City sold the young goalkeeper to Burnley in 2023 for £15million, which included a sell-on clause worth 20% of any profit.<br><br>With the move to St James’ Park set to net the Clarets upwards of £30million, City are in line for another tasty windfall, with at least £3million of that fee set to be diverted to the Etihad.<br><br>That would be the latest example of how City have managed to profit from the sales of academy graduates, turning an impressive supply of players into a valuable source of finance.<br><br>Making the grade at the Etihad is difficult, but as Trafford’s development shows, plenty of City alumni go on to have outstanding careers elsewhere in the game.<br><br>In the last three years, City have now raised more than £200million from the sales of academy graduates, with some of those sell-on clauses boosting that figure.<br><br>Liam Delap’s move from Ipswich Town to Chelsea this summer has already seen City make £2million. They raised a similar fee when Morgan Rogers moved from Middlesbrough to Aston Villa and another goalkeeper, Aro Muric, also secured extra profit when he swapped Burnley for Ipswich.<br><br>Maybe the best example is Romeo Lavia, whom City sold to Southampton for £10.5million but who then banked a similar sum when he left St Mary’s to move to Chelsea for £58million.<br><br>So while Alfa-Ruprecht has left the club without really making a mark, his future will remain a subject of interest and there could be similar deals ahead.<br><br>Last season, City’s Under-21 team topped Premier League 2 before being crowned champions after winning the play-off system, while the Under-18s went on a 26-game winning run at one stage but fell short in two finals.<br><br>It does show that the supply line is still there. City will likely sell a few more academy graduates before the transfer window is out, and you can expect those deals to also include sell-on clauses.<br><br>Here at the Manchester Evening News, we’re dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester City coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don’t miss out on the latest City news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
