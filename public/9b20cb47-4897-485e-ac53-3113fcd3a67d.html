The Manchester City centre-back was out at Hull last year and will be hoping to play a part in Reading's promotion push.<br><br>Burns is one of a number of City youngsters who was out on loan last season, and some of those are now ready to secure a permanent move elsewhere. However, there are others who fit into the same category as Burns and would be best served by going out on a temporary deal again.<br><br>In a similar position is young defender Jadel Katongo, who was brilliant in the same division for Peterborough in the 2023/24 season. His performances were so impressive that it led to the club's chairman making a bold prediction about his future.<br><br>"Let’s talk about Jadel Katongo, Man City, been fantastic with us, by the way,” Darragh MacAnthony said. “He’s probably going to be worth £100 million in two, three years’ time."<br><br>Katongo returned to Peterborough last season but things didn't go as well with injuries disrupting his season. The potential is there but the 20-year-old could do with another move to get some momentum back.<br><br>Also at Peterborough last year was midfielder Mahamadou Susoho, who enjoyed a better time despite a serious injury sidelining him for the first half of the season. He came on strong in the second half of their campaign and proved a valuable asset in their team.<br><br>Young left-back Tom Galvez set out on his first loan last season, making an ambitious move to LASK in Austria. He did get some appearances there but not many, and the decision was made for him to go to Dutch second division side Cambuur in January.<br><br>The 20-year-old needs another move to continue that progression and a loan feels like the best option for him as he finds his level in senior football.<br><br>Marcus Bettinelli's signing to replace Scott Carson also closes the door on an academy goalkeeper stepping up to the first team. Pep Guardiola has turned to the academy in the past for goalkeepers but liked the experience that Carson brought and is looking to carry that on with Bettinelli.<br><br>Spike Brits and Oliver Whatmuff were the two goalkeepers that played most for the Under-21s last season and it feels like whichever isn't the regular stopper for Ben Wilkinson this season needs to be heading out on loan.<br><br>There is the potential for both to go but one will likely be kept for the Under-21s; the pair are also still young enough to play in the UEFA Youth League, so that won't come into any decision.<br><br>Kevin de Bruyne is one of - if not the - greatest players to play for Manchester City.<br><br>He leaves the club having won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, five League Cups and a memorable Champions League victory!<br><br>To mark his amazing time at the Etihad Stadium, this special edition has been produced - KDB The King - to celebrate Kev's career with the Blues. We look back at his 10 best games in Blue, celebrate his title wins and hear from the City boss and a host of team-mates and football elite who give their views on what makes him so special.<br><br>Here at the Manchester Evening News, we’re dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester City coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don’t miss out on the latest City news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
