          <h1>What Hugo Ekitike told team-mates amid Newcastle transfer talks and Liverpool interest</h1>
          <div>Hugo Ekitike has spoken honestly to his Eintracht Frankfurt team-mates about his future as he continues to be linked with a move to the Premier League. Liverpool have been touted as possible suitors for the striker while Newcastle United are reportedly stepping up their own interest.<br><br>The Magpies have reportedly held talks with both the Bundesliga outfit and Ekitike’s representatives. Frankfurta are said to be demanding £86m for his signature. Were Newcastle to sign him, he would replace Alexander Isak as their club-record signing.<br><br>The Chronicle, sister-site to the ECHO, reports that Newcastle are hoping to agree a fee closer to £70m for the 23-year-old.<br><br>However, they suggest Liverpool might step up their interest in the Frenchman off the back of the Magpies’ move.<br><br>Frankfurt defender Timothy Chandler has been speaking about Ekitike’s future. And while he’s aware that the forward could move on, he is convinced his team-mate will not down tools to force an exit.<br><br>"I really don't think so, I have to say it," Chandler told BILD. "He's very open about it; we talked about it on the first day (of pre-season).<br><br>“If he stays here, he'll do anything for Eintracht. I completely believe him.<br><br>"He's pushing hard. You really have to say that. And he says: If something happens, then something happens; if not, then not.<br><br>“As long as he's here, he'll push hard and is a very, very good boy. And I also know that even if he ends up staying here, he'll give it his all.”<br><br>Ekitike scored 22 goals in 48 games across all competitions last season as he helped Frankfurt qualify for the Champions League.<br><br>Former Liverpool strikers Erik Meijer and Sean Dundee, who currently serve as pundit and co-commentator in the Bundesliga respectively, are both huge admirers of Ekitike and believe he would be a good signing for their old club if they were to make a move.<br><br>“Yeah, Ekitike has a very good season. Last season was already good, he was on a loan,” Meijer told the ECHO in an exclusive interview. “And now he is on a contract in Frankfurt, phwoar, he played a very good season!<br><br>“He has abilities that also would fit in at Liverpool. Speed, technically he's really on a high, high level. The only thing he doesn't have is a lot of experience.<br><br>“The last one and a half years he played all the matches at Frankfurt, so his level went up step by step and he was the main goalscorer at Frankfurt after Marmoush left to Manchester City.<br><br>“Everybody thought, oh, now Frankfurt is going to have problems, but Ekitike got better and better. He's on a very good level.<br><br>“He has the abilities that fit into the team very well and fit into the system that Slot wants to play.<br><br>“He needs players who are technically brilliant, who have speed and who are tactically on a very high level to know where the spaces are. He plays that way.”<br><br>Meanwhile, Dundee exclusively told the ECHO: “There's a few good strikers around. Hugo Ekitike is a very good player.<br><br>“Frankfurt, what they've done over the years, they've always had really good strikers, and they're always losing them!<br><br>“But he's also a very, very good striker. But we’ll have to wait and see (if he could join Liverpool).”</div>
