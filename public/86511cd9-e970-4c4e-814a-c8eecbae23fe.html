The player has been in London completing a medical after saying goodbye to his La Liga sideâ€™s teammates.<br><br>He is set to become the third Spanish addition this summer after deals for Martin Zubimendi and Kepa Arrizabalaga. But he will fill a role in the squad that was sorely needed in seasons gone by.<br><br>With that in mind, football.london look at the three major problems that Mosquera is coming in to solve. From depth to key roles to elements that were not previously possessed.<br><br>Jakub Kiwior played a critical role for Arsenal last season when Gabriel Magalhaes' injury kept him out for an extended period. Riccardo Calafiori was also missing for much of the campaign, which the Pole helped deal with, but on the right, the Gunners have lacked depth.<br><br>Mosquera now solves that problem and gives William Saliba some respite for games and provides the depth should Mikel Arteta need to make an early change to rest legs or rotate. The Spaniard has also played as a right-back for Valencia, offering even more depth in desperate moments.<br><br>Mentioning Saliba, there has always been a fear that Arsenal might one day lose their star defender. His contract continues to run down while the club, despite being understood to be calm, are trying to renew his terms.<br><br>Real Madrid have long been a suitor of Saliba, and having a 21-year-old talented defender coming in, it does ease that burden somewhat. Thankfully, the club is preparing for a future with both, not one over the other.<br><br>Cup competitions have been an issue for Arsenal at times, and many have complained that the club did not take them seriously enough. Rob Holding was previously handed a start at Manchester City when Saliba was dropped to the bench for the big game.<br><br>Having better quality to come in and replace these starting figures should mean cup runs can be tackled more successfully. Mosquera, in addition to the likes of Noni Madueke and Christian Norgaard, will be designed for these very moments.<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
