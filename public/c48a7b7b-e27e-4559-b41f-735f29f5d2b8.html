MEN Sport understands a third bid has been submitted for Mbeumo by the Reds valued at a total cost of £70m.<br><br>There is confidence in the United camp that this bid will be accepted and you imagine if it is, it should be relatively straightforward for this deal to be completed. While there can be an initial grace period of relief and excitement that a long-running transfer saga is finally at an end, the hard work for two men is only just beginning.<br><br>For Mbeumo, he will need to quickly adapt to life at a club the size of United. So far in his career, he has played for clubs that are no way comparable to the size and scale of the Reds.<br><br>While he is clearly comfortable playing in the Premier League, it is all the added bits which often go unnoticed that Mbeumo will need to get his head around and juggle alongside his on-pitch performances. Of course, he will not have to do this alone and that is where Ruben Amorim comes in.<br><br>The Portuguese head coach admitted last season that he was not prepared for the media exposure that comes with being in the United hotseat. With that, comes added scrutiny which is not just felt by the head coach but the players too.<br><br>Considering how long the Mbeumo deal has taken to reach even this stage, there will be a high scrutiny on both men as this plays out. While in modern football £70m is a reasonably high fee for a player, it is a particularly large investment considering there is no European competitions coming to Old Trafford this season.<br><br>Such a fee comes with expectations and it will be Amorim's job to try and protect Mbeumo from the outside noise. His ability to do that and the Cameroonian's temperament could ultimately make or break both men's careers.<br><br>The signing of Antony from Ajax is evidence that both player and manager can fall victim to the large price tag plonked on their heads. The Brazilian's failure to adapt quickly to his new surroundings led to him being quickly cast aside once Amorim arrived.<br><br>This is after Erik ten Hag seemingly failed to acknowledge that his purchase was just not working. In many ways, Mbeumo is Amorim's Antony - a player that the Portuguese boss wanted enough to keep sticking with the negotiations for so long.<br><br>Now he is on the verge of arriving, it is up to Amorim to nurture an environment where Mbeumo can replicate his Brentford form.<br><br>Here at The Manchester Evening News, we are dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don't miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
