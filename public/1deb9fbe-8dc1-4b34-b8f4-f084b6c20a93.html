Thus far, only one of those aims has been completed with Kepa Arrizabalaga signing from Chelsea after his £5million release clause was activated.<br><br>The three other positions do look set to be addressed very soon as deals have been finalised for Valencia centre-back Cristhian Mosquera and Chelsea winger Noni Madueke. Advanced discussions for Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres have also been ongoing for the last few weeks.<br><br>These additions are set to come alongside Martin Zubimendi, with that deal virtually completed in February, and Christian Norgaard, who arrived from Brentford as the replacement for Jorginho. However, it could have been very different.<br><br>Before the Gunners could finalise Zubimendi's switch from Real Sociedad, Spanish giants Real Madrid attempted to hijack that move. Though the midfielder had already decided to join Arsenal, it looks as though no chances were taken with Berta very quickly identifying an alternative.<br><br>According to German outlet Bild, the Gunners made a move to sign Joao Palhinha from Bayern Munich earlier this summer but were unable to agree on a fee. Before departing Fulham for the Bundesliga champions in a £47.3million deal, the Portugal international had been linked with Arsenal.<br><br>Such an approach is further proof of Berta's ability to engage in talks with multiple targets and thus be flexible in the market with that ability showcased by how easily the club pivoted from RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko to Gyokeres.<br><br>Though nothing was agreed, the future of Palhinha still appears to be uncertain but the man himself is determined to make things work at Bayern following a tough first season under Vincent Kompany.<br><br>"I have a contract for three more years, so I’ll report for duty on July 29, which is when we start this pre-season," he told Portuguese outlet Sport TV, via Metro, on Thursday.<br><br>"As I’ve said several times, and it’s been a recurring question, I have three more years on my contract. I don’t know what will happen, but I’m at a great club, as I’ve always said.<br><br>"Obviously, it hasn’t been an easy year, but as soon as the season starts, I’m very motivated to prove my worth once again at a very special club, a huge club."</div></body></html>
