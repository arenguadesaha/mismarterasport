You can follow Steven on Twitter at @StevenRailston.<br><br>The wheels of the transfer window are turning and Manchester United must get a move on.<br><br>United have been locked in discussions with Brentford over Bryan Mbeumo for over a month now and club sources are insistent they will only negotiate a deal for a sensible price.<br><br>Brentford have rejected two offers from United, the second for more than £60million, and the suggestion is the London club have valued the 25-year-old closer to the £70m mark.<br><br>Mbeumo indicated he wanted a move to Old Trafford long ago, but negotiations have stalled and the news of Newcastle having an interest in Yoane Wissa should give United chiefs a kick up the backside.<br><br>Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.<br><br>Liverpool are pushing to sign Hugo Ekitike and Newcastle have turned their attention to Wissa, which could have consequences for United and their dragged out pursuit of Mbeumo.<br><br>Brentford do not want to lose Mbeumo and Wissa, who contributed an impressive 40 goals and 14 assists between them last season, in the same transfer window and might only sanction an exit for one or the other.<br><br>Newcastle's interest in Wissa will not have gone unnoticed at Old Trafford and perhaps it will sharpen minds to end the Mbeumo transfer saga and finally negotiate a breakthrough.<br><br>Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to change United's reputation in the transfer market and the club does not want to overpay, committing the mistakes of the previous regime, but £70m is probably not unreasonable.<br><br>Matheus Cunha (17 goals last season) was signed for £62.5m, Anthony Elanga (six goals) signed for Newcastle in a £50m deal and Chelsea signed Jamie Gittens (12 goals) from Borussia Dortmund for £51.5m.<br><br>Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League for Brentford. The market is inflated, but every club is working in the same environment and there is no point in haggling over a few million.<br><br>Having said that, if United truly do not want to pay £70m to sign Mbeumo, then they need to pull the plug on the deal and immediately move on to an alternative - but who is that player?<br><br>Mbeumo is Premier League proven, having been one of the most consistent performers in the league over the last few seasons, and there is minimal risk involved with his potential move.<br><br>United are still scarred by signing Antony from Ajax in a £86m deal and that transfer will haunt the club for a few more years, but Antony was unproven and a significantly bigger risk.<br><br>Mbeumo is a safer bet, although it's said 'the house always wins' and Brentford certainly won't mind if they sell Wissa to Newcastle for a decent fee and keep Mbeumo for the new season.<br><br>A game of poker has developed between United and Brentford, but the Bees hold the cards.</div></body></html>
