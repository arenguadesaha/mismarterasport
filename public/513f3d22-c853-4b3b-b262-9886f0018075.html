United's initial bid of £55million did not tempt the Bees, but The Manchester Evening News understands the Reds submitted a revised offer exceeding £60m several weeks ago.<br><br>At the time it was understood that would be enough for Brentford, but negotiations remain ongoing. It is understood that the Reds are still working on a deal to sign Mbeumo so he can feature on the club's pre-season tour of the United States.<br><br>After their first pre-season friendly against Leeds United in Stockholm on Saturday, United travel to Chicago on Tuesday and will be based in the city for the majority of their three-match tour.<br><br>However, United's potential deal for Mbeumo will reportedly be affected by interest in Brentford striker Yoane Wissa. It has been reported that the Bees are unlikely to sell both Mbeumo and Wissa in the same window.<br><br>And BBC Sport report that Newcastle United are expected to accelerate their interest in Wissa in the next 24 hours after withdrawing from their pursuit of Hugo Ekitike.<br><br>Wissa is said to be open to leaving the Bees for a chance to play in the Champions League, and Tottenham Hotspur are also reportedly interested.<br><br>Wissa's departure from the Gtech Community Stadium would make any deal for Mbeumo extremely difficult and represent a huge blow to the Reds.<br><br>United have signed just two players this summer.
