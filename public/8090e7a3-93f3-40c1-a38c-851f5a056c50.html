The Uruguayan ultimately failed to convince under Arne Slot last season as he found his opportunities limited.<br><br>Nunez made 47 appearances in all competitions but he started only 17 times with just eight of them coming in the Premier League. Meanwhile, he scored only seven goals as the late Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz were both preferred at centre-forward ahead of him.<br><br>The Reds did knock back an approach from Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal to sign Nunez back in January.<br><br>But they reportedly remain interested in the 26-year-old as Liverpool step up their attempts to bolster their attacking options.<br><br>AC Milan and Atletico Madrid had previously been touted as possible suitors for Nunez, though such links have quietened in recent weeks.<br><br>Consequently, Napoli had previously been favourites to sign the strike, with their former midfielder, Walter Gargano, even revealing his old Penarol team-mate had confirmed his desire to move to Naples.<br><br>"Nunez? The warmth of the Neapolitans would do him a lot of good,” Gargano said on radio channel Kiss Kiss Napoli. “I spoke to him about a week ago and I hope he really comes to Naples.<br><br>"I told him; 'Go to Naples!'. He and his family will decide what to do with his future.<br><br>"He told me; 'Yes, I'll come to Naples right away. I'm waiting to close with Naples'.”<br><br>However, the latest reports from Italy suggest that Nunez will be left disappointed. Both Sky in Italy and Fabrizio Romano suggest that Napoli have ended their interest after deciding to sign Lorenzo Lucca from Udinese instead.<br><br>But despite a Napoli transfer seemingly no longer being on the cards, interest from Al-Hilal remains.<br><br>When the Saudi Pro League outfit first tried to sign the Reds No.9 back in January, their manager was Jorge Jesus, who was Nunez's former boss at Benfica.<br><br>Under Jesus, the forward had ultimately produced the best football of his career. He returned 32 goals and 14 assists from just 66 matches over an 18-month period in the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons, prior to Jesus’ departure, with such form helping attract the interest of Liverpool in the first place.<br><br>It is easy to see why a reunion might have been of interest to both player and coach.<br><br>Yet Al-Hilal’s current interest is with former Inter Milan boss Simeone Inzaghi at the helm, after Jesus left the club back in May.<br><br>However, the 70-year-old is now back in the dugout in the Saudi Pro League after taking over at Al-Nassr earlier this week.<br><br>And his new club are set to be in the market for a new striker after Jhon Duran joined Fenerbahce on loan for the season, barely six months after joining in an initial £64m deal.<br><br>Following the signing of Theo Hernandez, Al-Hilal are currently boasting their full quota of 10 foreign players. In contrast, Al-Nassr, who still boast Cristiano Ronaldo and Sadio Mane among their ranks, currently have one space free.<br><br>With a World Cup looming at the end of the season, Nunez will be well aware he can’t afford to spend another campaign on the bench. And should he indeed move on, he will be desperate to rediscover his best form in front of goal.<br><br>While Al-Hilal’s interest might be long-standing, a reunion with Jesus could prove to be even more appealing, should Nunez’s Liverpool career indeed be drawing to a close.</div></body></html>
