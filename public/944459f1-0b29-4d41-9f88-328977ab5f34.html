The 23-year-old has come on leaps and bounds since joining Eintracht Frankfurt from PSG, with the striker netting 22 goals in 48 appearances for the German side last season.<br><br>The Frenchman's form and potential has seen him linked with a host of clubs this summer, with Liverpool and Chelsea among the sides interested. football.london understands Ekitike has been on the club's radar for some time, though it's believed the Blues have been put off somewhat by Frankfurt's £85million asking price.<br><br>It's since emerged that Newcastle are considering making a move for the striker, with the Magpies holding secret talks in Germany last week. Our sister title Chronicle Live understands that those conversations remain active and the big question for Newcastle appears to be whether there is any wiggle room on the huge asking price. Reports in Germany have suggested that the Premier League club will make their first offer for Ekitike in the coming days.<br><br>Of course, Chelsea have already signed Liam Delap and Joao Pedro this summer from Ipswich Town and Brighton, respectively. The pair cost a combined £90million and it seems unlikely that the Blues would spend big on yet another striker.<br><br>It's possible, though, that this changes should Nicolas Jackson leave the club. The 24-year-old, who signed a two-year contract extension at Stamford Bridge last year, has been linked with a move away from west London, with interest from the Premier League and overseas. football.london reported last month that Chelsea are pleased with how Jackson has come on and are planning the upcoming season with the Senegal international in the squad, although it remains a very fluid situation, especially with the club having signed Delap and Pedro.<br><br>According to Sky Sports News reporter and presenter, Dharmesh Sheth, a number of clubs are keeping tabs on the situation, with Manchester United, Aston Villa and AC Milan the clubs named. If Jackson does indeed depart, Chelsea may want to sign a replacement, especially as Delap is still relatively young and Pedro is seen as more of a versatile frontman who can do a job across the frontline and even in the No.10 role.<br><br>Ekitike may soon be off limits though, given Newcastle's interest, so the club may be forced to took at alternatives. One striker who is available is Victor Osimhen. The 26-year-old spent last campaign on loan at Galatasaray and scored 37 goals in 41 games. The Nigerian has no future at Napoli and has been told he can leave if a club pays his £64million release clause.<br><br>Galatasaray are interested in signing the striker permanently but Napoli have reportedly asked for the release clause to be paid in two instalments. The Italian side are also said to want a sell-on clause put into any deal.<br><br>football.london understands Chelsea have tracked Osimhen for some time and even explored a deal in January. His wages could be an issue, however, and a compromise may need to be found for any deal to be done.<br><br>Osimhen would be a ready-made striker, should he join Chelsea this summer, and would offer a clinical edge not seen at Stamford Bridge for some time. A lot may depend on finances and other incomings and outgoings, though. It's definitely one to keep an eye on, for sure.<br><br>Want to keep up to date with the breaking and important Chelsea stories whilst on the move?
