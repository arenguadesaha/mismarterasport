The 26-year-old striker was heavily linked with a move to the Premier League last summer, but a deal collapsed, so he joined Galatasaray on loan instead.<br><br>Osimhen, who has recently entered the final year of his contract in Naples, featured 30 times in the Süper Lig this season, scoring 26 goals and providing five assists. Playing a key role in Okan Buruk's squad, the Nigeria international fired the club to a third successive title.<br><br>He also helped Galatasaray clinch the domestic double, netting a brace against Trabzonspor in the Turkish Cup final. Osimhen was once mooted as a potential target for Manchester United, but now he looks set to stay in Istanbul.<br><br>So, with that being said, the Manchester Evening News has rounded up everything you need to know about Osimhen and a potential move to Old Trafford.<br><br>According Sacha Tavolieri, Galatasaray have reached an agreement with Napoli to sign Osimhen. The report claims that the Turkish giants have 'never been so close' to securing the Nigerian's signature, with a €75m (£65m) payment plan in place.<br><br>Meanwhile, Fabrizio Romano has reported that negotiations are still ongoing between the two clubs. It's said that Napoli have recently sent a counter-proposal to Galatasaray, who are ready to make a decision on the 'new conditions'.<br><br>According to German outlet Bild, Newcastle have shortlisted Osimhen and Darwin Nunez as potential targets after dropping out of the race to sign Hugo Ekitike. The report claims that the Eintracht Frankfurt striker has decided that he wants to join Liverpool, who have signalled that they're willing to pay his €100m (£85m) price tag.<br><br>It's said that the Premier League champions have already agreed personal terms with Ekitike, who wasn't convinced by a move to St. James' Park. Bild reckons that the Magpies have bid €80m (£69m) for the 23-year-old striker, but the offer was rejected.<br><br>Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.<br><br>According to the Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport, in June, United considered offering Napoli a player-plus-cash deal involving Joshua Zirkzee for Osimhen. The report claims that the Nigerian was aware of interest from Old Trafford, but a move never materialised.<br><br>It's said that United were 'reluctant' to pay the €75m (£65m) release clause in his contract, so they 'studied' how to finance a bid. La Gazzetta dello Sport added that Osimhen rejected an offer from Al-Hilal at the time.<br><br>Towards the end of May, the Galatasaray boss provided an update on Osimhen's future. In an interview with 'I Just Spoke', as quoted by Turkish outlet NTV Sport, Buruk shut down rumours linking the striker with a move to Saudi Arabia.<br><br>"Osimhen will look at the conditions," he said. "He's very happy here at Galatasaray. He's living the best days of his life. The player will decide about his future, as he's made an incredible contribution here. We need to respect him, but we are hopeful that he will stay with us."<br><br>Buruk added: "He's a professional player. There are talks about it, but Osimhen will make the choice. He will look at the conditions. The part about Osimhen agreeing with the [Saudi] Arabian side is not true."<br><br>Subscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.<br><br>Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.
