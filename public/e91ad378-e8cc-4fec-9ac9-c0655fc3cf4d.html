A Bola revealed one banner's message: "I don't cry for those who leave, I'm happy for those who stay."<br><br>Another declared: "No one is above the club's interests, no matter who they are."<br><br>Gyokeres has been a goal machine for Sporting, smashing in 97 goals in 102 games since his Â£20million switch from Coventry in 2023, contributing to two league triumphs and a Taca de Portugal victory, reports the Mirror.<br><br>However, the 27-year-old striker's departure could be marred by controversy as he faces a potential fine for skipping pre-season training with Sporting.<br><br>"We're calm," Sporting president Frederico Varandas told Agencia Lusa. "Everything can be solved with the closure of the market, a hefty fine and an apology to the group. If they don't want to pay Viktor's fair market value, we'll be very comfortable with that for the next three years.<br><br>"If the geniuses who are devising this strategy think that this puts pressure on me to make it easier for him to leave, not only are they completely wrong, but they are also making it more complicated for the player to leave. No one is above the interests of the club. Whoever they are."<br><br>When questioned about his future by L'Equipe, Gyokeres expressed his ambition to establish himself in the Premier League, having failed to make a single top-flight appearance during his Brighton spell.<br><br>"It's one of the biggest leagues in Europe," Gyokeres said. "I spent several years there without being able to play a single match. So, of course, it's something I would like to do. It would be a great revenge."<br><br>He added: "It's football, you never know. I'm not thinking about it, we'll see what happens. If something is going to happen, it will happen. The most important thing for me is to play for a club that really wants me.<br><br>"I'm definitely one of the [best strikers in the world]. It's difficult to rank me but yes, I'm at the same table as them now. What I managed to do at Sporting, I'm convinced I can do anywhere.
