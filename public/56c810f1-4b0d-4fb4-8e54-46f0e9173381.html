It's proven to be a frustrating pursuit so far, with Brentford knocking back two bids and now considering an improved third.<br><br>United are now hoping that a package worth £70 million will be enough to convince the London club to part ways with Mbeumo, who has one year left on his current contract and could leave for nothing next year. United are privately confident that this will be end of the matter, and it marks a significant improvement on the opening salvo of £55m.<br><br>Some fans don't think Mbeumo is worth that much to Amorim, and that the club risk signalling to other teams that the trope of the "United tax", where the club will overpay for their targets, is alive and well. Reader Bazred1 says: "Started too low before paying what Brentford wanted. This is no way to stop the tax on United transfers."<br><br>Commenter Fanaticmanufan writes: "If the club do manage to get Mbeumo, at this ‘inflated’ price, I sincerely hope it is worth it and that he is not a dud."<br><br>Trouble4 says: "I think this deal is risky at 70m. Coupled with the fact that we supposed to no longer cave in to the United tax and here we are looking at doing it again.<br><br>"Then again, when you look at the valuations for all players at the moment, it's hard to tell if it's over the top or not. And no doubt Brentford are going to waddle like ducks over the 5m in add ons. In which case we have to pull out."<br><br>Our team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new free WhatsApp community.

I hope that Brentford don’t try to be cute this time. They wanted an offer worth £70m, and they have got it. I’m sure that the wait will be worth it to all at Old Trafford, and the worldwide Manchester United fans."<br><br>Brav3339 writes: "Held to ransom yet again.
