The Brazilian, 24, moved to the West Midlands in a £15million deal from Fluminense in August 2024.<br><br>However, after less than 12 months at Molineux, Andre could be on the move again. Corriere dello Sport have reported that United, Liverpool and Juventus are interested in the 5'9" midfielder. It's added that Andre could be available for as little as £30m.<br><br>Andre impressed in his debut season at Wolves, forming a solid midfield partnership with compatriot Joao Gomes. He completed 93 per cent of his passes in the Premier League last term, winning 59 per cent of his duels with an average of six recoveries and three tackles per match. Although Andre doesn't have much aerial presence, he makes up for that with his work rate and high-octane running.<br><br>His playing style would fit perfectly at United and would surely be the ideal teammate for Matheus Cunha, who signed for the Reds in a £62.5m move at the start of last month. Andre and Cunha played together at Wolves last season and are both involved with the Brazil national team.<br><br>The duo have formed quite a close relationship since Andre decided to move to Wolves and that helped them put in a number of impressive performances on the pitch. Cunha was Wolves' standout performer last term with 17 goals and six assists in 36 appearances, but Andre wasn't far behind.<br><br>It felt as though Andre's impact and presence in the middle of midfield helped open up space for Cunha to create opportunities and work up some magic in the final third.<br><br>While Cunha might hit the ground running no matter who he has behind him, it has been proven that he can perform alongside Andre and therefore they could be the ideal fit together for United.<br><br>Former Wolves star Dave Edwards heaped praise on Andre back in March and described him as one of the best defensive midfielders in the Premier League. He said: "I could talk about Andre all day.<br><br>"Very rarely do you see so much passion for defensive actions. He celebrates it like a goal, because, in reality, it’s as big as a goal, because he's stopping an attack, a moment for the opposition.<br><br>"It's great to see it means so much to do that side of the game because everybody wants to be the goal scorer, everybody wants to be the person creating and doing the tricks, but to take so much pride in that defensive work is magnificent, and every team needs players who do that.<br><br>"You can't just have a team of tricksters and flare players. You have to have an Andre in the team who is such an important cog in the wheel. He wins the ball back so many times.<br><br>"A lot of the time it's after we've had an attack, it breaks down, and then he's there to pick up the pieces and we start another attack. That just keeps the opposition under pressure and that's so important."<br><br>Edwards added: "He is one of the best number sixes in the league, there's no doubt about that. He really is at the top end of ballplaying central midfielders who start attacks. I've been delighted to see how much he's improved since he's come in, how effective he's now becoming for Wolves, and now how important he is.<br><br>"I'm looking forward to seeing many more games of Andre dictating the play for Wolves."<br><br>Our team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new free WhatsApp community.
