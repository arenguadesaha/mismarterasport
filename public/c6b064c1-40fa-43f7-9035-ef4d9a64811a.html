But that is about to change after UEFA made a controversial change to the tournament.<br><br>The governing body has confirmed the new seeding regulations for the Champions League knockout rounds, having previously revealed that the rules would be changed so home advantage in second legs is decided by merit rather than random draws - as was the case last season.<br><br>UEFA have now confirmed the new seeding regulations, reports ESPN, but they have resisted giving full advantage to the sides that finish highest in the league phase.<br><br>Teams ranked first, second, third and four are guaranteed to be at home for both the round of 16 and quarter-finals, providing they progress. If they are eliminated, the side that knocks them out in the round of 16 will claim their second-leg home advantage.<br><br>Meanwhile, only the teams who finish first or second are guaranteed home advantage in the second leg of the semi-finals, providing they get there.<br><br>Last year, Liverpool were at home in their second leg against Paris Saint-Germain due to league phase position, only to be knocked out on penalties.<br><br>The Champions League draw would have seen them drawn away from home in the quarter-final second leg against Aston Villa, but they would have been drawn at home for the semi-final second leg against Arsenal.<br><br>Under the new regulations, they would have been at home for all second legs in the knock-out stages courtesy of their top-two finish, with PSG then inheriting it after knocking the Reds out.<br><br>This means that had the new regulations been in place last season, PSG would have remained at home for the semi-final second leg, courtesy of eliminating Liverpool, despite finishing 15th in the league phase, with third place Arsenal gaining no advantage in the final four through league position.<br><br>According to ESPN, the new regulations also creates an imbalance, putting the sides who finish third and fourth at a disadvantage as it will be impossible for them to be at home in a semi-final second leg.<br><br>Likewise, the teams that finish fifth and six, while bypassing the knockout phase play-offs and obtaining a second-leg home advantage in the round of 16, they would then have to be away from home in the second legs in both the quarter and semi-finals.<br><br>Only the sides who finish in the following positions can get a home second leg in the semi-final, courtesy of how the knockout phase draw is done: first, second, seventh, eighth, ninth, 10th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 23rd, 24th.<br><br>Consequently, there is at least now a greater incentive to finish in the top two, as Liverpool managed last season.<br><br>But should you not finish in the top two, it becomes a little more complicated when it comes to whether or not your league position actually results in much of an advantage in the knock out stages.<br><br>Liverpool already know they will be in pot one for the Champions League league phase draw on August 28.</div></body></html>
