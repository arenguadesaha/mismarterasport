Mikel Arteta's side want to sign a new No.9 in the summer transfer window and are closing in on a deal to bring Sporting CP forward Gyokeres to the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>The Gunners have agreed a deal worth £63.8million for Gyokeres, who is expected to sign a five-year contract. The 27-year-old is due to travel to north London for a medical and to complete the formalities of a move. He scored 54 goals and provided 13 assists in 52 appearances for Sporting last season.<br><br>However, there are some Arsenal fans that might be regretting the club's move to sign Gyokeres after Liverpool made an approach for Newcastle United ace Isak on Tuesday. The Gunners have been long linked with Isak but Arne Slot's side are now making their move to attempt to lure him to Anfield.<br><br>Despite this, TBR Football has reported that Arsenal are delighted with their decision to sign Gyokeres from Sporting and are not disappointed about not waiting for Isak.<br><br>It's added that Arsenal made the decision to move on from pursuing a move for Isak earlier this summer and instead focused on Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig. Newcastle striker Isak made it known that his preferred choice would have been Liverpool, hence why the Gunners looked elsewhere.<br><br>Arsenal are close to completing a deal for Gyokeres following a breakthrough on Sunday. Sporting's £60.5m plus £8.6m demand looked to have put a deal on hold, but talks were reignited across the weekend and the Gunners are now confident to sign the former Coventry City forward for a reduced fee.<br><br>Arteta's men are anticipated to spend £54.8m plus £8.6m in add-ons to bring Gyokeres to the Emirates, £5.7m less than Sporting's initial demand for the forward. While Arsenal have negotiated a lower fee, Sporting no longer have to pay a 10 per cent agent commission, which was required in their initial asking price.<br><br>Gyokeres' agent has, therefore, allowed Arsenal to spend less, while Sporting are scheduled to receive the same amount, due to not having to deduct a now waived commission in a move crucial to securing an agreement.<br><br>As well as this, Gyokeres has not turned up to pre-season training at Sporting in a bid to force through a move. He has made it clear that Arsenal is his preferred destination, despite interest from Manchester United.<br><br>Elsewhere, the Gunners have made a fast start to July as they ramp up their transfer business. They have signed three players this month, as Kepa Arrizabalaga arrived in a £5m swoop from Chelsea, Martin Zubimendi made the £51m move from Real Sociedad and Christian Norgaard signed for £10m from Brentford.<br><br>More are expected to follow. Noni Madueke is closing in on a £52million switch from Chelsea, while Gyokeres is set to sign from Sporting and Cristhian Mosquera is on course to make the £13m move from Valencia.<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
