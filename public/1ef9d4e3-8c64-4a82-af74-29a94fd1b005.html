Merit payments were also down from the international market.<br><br>What that meant for United was that, through significantly poorer performance year on year, they brought in £6.2m from merit payments from the international market for finishing 15th, while the previous year they earned £14.7m for an eighth-placed finish.<br><br>The merit payments derived from the domestic market came to £9.7m, down from the £22m that was achieved the previous season.<br><br>In a statement accompanying the release of the central payments to clubs, the Premier League stated: “The collective marketing of Premier League rights and the League's revenue distribution formula assist clubs in their efforts to develop and acquire talented players, as well as build and improve stadiums for fans.<br><br>In its payments to clubs, the Premier League is the most equitable of Europe's major leagues and makes a significant annual funding contribution to the domestic football pyramid, community programmes and wider good causes.<br><br>“In Season 2024/25, the Premier League committed more than £550m to the wider game.”<br><br>Here at The Manchester Evening News, we are dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don't miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
