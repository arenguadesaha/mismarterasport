He was like, ‘I think you have to sing at the game on Sunday. You’re singing ‘Can’t help falling in love with you’, which is Preston North End’s anthem.<br><br>“And I sang that about two years ago on New Year’s Day. I was like, ‘Oh my god, that’s such a big thing! Yeah, no problem. I know the song, it’s fine.’<br><br>“And then I called the person who we liaise with and he was like, ‘So you know you’re singing the two songs?’ And that was only on Friday I found that out.<br><br>“So that was probably like the scariest phone call I’ve ever had because I had just been preparing one song the whole time.<br><br>“Then you get told you'll be singing the biggest song ever, You'll Never Walk Alone.<br><br>“So I was, I think the whole weekend, in my mum and dad's house, I just sang that and the neighbours must have just been pulling their ears out, saying, 'why is she singing this song over and over again?'.<br><br>“But I just wanted to do it justice and had it perfectly sung. I didn’t want to do anything that was like… put too many embellishments or anything on it because it should be sung the way the fans sing it.<br><br>“So it was quite scary but I just wanted to do it justice.”<br><br>Maguire thanked supporters for all the messages and comments she had received following the rendition as she revealed she would remember Reds fans singing along with her forever.<br><br>“As weird as it sounds, it was a relief (when it was over),” she said. “The whole time I just kept saying to myself, ‘Close your eyes and do not look at any fans’.<br><br>“Because I think if I opened my eyes and looked around, I would have just burst into tears because of what it meant on the day especially.<br><br>“I’ve been to Liverpool matches before and when you hear them sing You’ll Never Walk Alone, it’s emotional even then.<br><br>“But with the added reason for it, I actually had to take myself out of the place and just sing the song.<br><br>“So when I finished the song and looked around, I actually felt like I was going to fall to the floor. I think it was all the nerves, like that relief, just knowing I had done it and it had gone okay and the fans were happy.<br><br>“Hearing them sing along with you is something that I will remember forever. But I think once I finished, it was definitely a relief.<br><br>“All the messages and comments I've got from fans, it has just been so overwhelming and I'm just so grateful for them.”<br><br>Maguire had also taken to social media on Sunday night as she reflected on being asked to sing both songs.<br><br>Posting a picture of her in front of the Liverpool supporters, she wrote: “A day for the memory books for my family and I today. Thank you @pnefc and @LFC for allowing me to be apart of this special day. Overwhelmed”.</div></body></html>
