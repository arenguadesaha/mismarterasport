While forwards were rotated, midfielders rested and centre-backs shuffled, the full-back positions, injuries permitting, were almost universally the same.<br><br>First under Jurgen Klopp and later Arne Slot, on the left was Andy Robertson, while manning the opposite flank was Trent Alexander-Arnold - arguably the most potent attacking full-back partnership in Europe for several years.<br><br>Now, though, that status quo has been changed, Alexander-Arnold having departed to Real Madrid in time for their failed FIFA Club World Cup endeavour and Robertson, now 31, moving beyond his prime years.<br><br>And the Scotland international is now involved in what at present is a five-way scrap for the two wide defensive roles as Liverpool prepare for the defence of the Premier League title they won at a canter last season.<br><br>Not since the fleeting days in the early 1990s when Kenny Dalglish seemed intent on cramming as many full-backs into his XI has there been such a competition for places in those positions.<br><br>Liverpool spent almost Â£70million in updating their options this summer, first triggering right-back Jeremie Frimpong's release clause at Bayer Leverkusen and then finally reaching an agreement with Bournemouth over long-term left-back target Milos Kerkez.<br><br>The arrival of the latter has been expected to prompt the departure of either Robertson or long-time deputy Kostas Tsimikas.<br><br>While Robertson, who is now in the last 12 months of his contract, emerged as a target for Atletico Madrid earlier in the summer, such transfer speculation has been quiet in recent weeks.<br><br>And the reaction of Tsimikas on social media after Sunday's 3-1 friendly win at Preston North End, when he referred to "season six episode one" of his Liverpool, hardly seemed that of a player planning on leaving any time soon.<br><br>Nevertheless, it would be a surprise if both Robertson and Tsimikas remain on the books by the time the transfer window closes on September 1.<br><br>Conor Bradley, meanwhile, will be hoping for an extended run of availability at right-back given injuries that have limited the 22-year-old to only 17 Premier League starts since making his debut in the competition two seasons ago.<br><br>The quintet all featured for 45 minutes each at Deepdale, albeit Robertson playing at centre-back for the second half alongside teenager Amara Nallo given Liverpool's lack of available options in the heart of defence.<br><br>Bradley was the biggest winner, his well-taken 33rd-minute opener the highlight of an all-action first-half showing. On the other flank, Tsimikas was more subdued going forward but contributed a couple of key defensive interventions early on.<br><br>The duo were replaced by Frimpong and Kerkez respectively at half-time. While the former had a couple of opportunities to demonstrate his searing pace and willingness to recover possession, it was the latter who greater caught the eye with his robust approach and strong engine up and down the flank.<br><br>What also impressed was both signs of an understanding with Cody Gakpo ahead of him and his willingness to underlap, which allowed Kerkez to play a number of passes through the lines for his forward colleagues. The loss of Alexander-Arnold's unparalleled passing range means Liverpool will need variety from their wide defensive options.<br><br>After an obviously disrupted start to pre-season, the Reds squad will now continue to work at the AXA Training Centre ahead of jetting out for their Far East tour next Monday.<br><br>Both Kerkez and Frimpong will be given opportunities to adapt to their new surrounds during the remainder of the warm-up programme. And the battle for the full-back roles ahead of the Premier League opener at home to Bournemouth is shaping up to be one of the more intriguing aspects of Liverpool's summer.</div></body></html>
