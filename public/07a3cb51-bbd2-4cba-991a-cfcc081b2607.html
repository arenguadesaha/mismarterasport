As it stands, Arne Slot has just three senior centre-backs at his disposal in Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate and Joe Gomez.<br><br>Palace’s Guehi, who has just one year remaining on his contract at Selhurst Park, has been widely reported as a potential target for Liverpool. However, it remains to be seen whether a deal can be agreed with the London club at a reasonable price.<br><br>Speaking to BoyleSports, who provide the latest Premier League odds, Pearce said Liverpool should be doing all they can to secure the defender’s signature this summer.<br><br>“I love Marc Guehi and I think he’s now England’s first defender on the team sheet," he said. "I think he's probably a better international centre-half than he is a Premier League centre-half, but he's low maintenance.<br><br>“Looking at him, he plays with real consistency and he reads the game well. For me, I would be looking to get him out of Crystal Palace if he's available.<br><br>"If you're Liverpool, to have him, Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk, wow, I would take him all day long. I think what he does really well is he reads the game when the ball is at the other end of the pitch.<br><br>"For counter-attacks and things like that, as I've seen with England, you might have the ball for a long period of time and you need a central defender continually reading the game and having the pace to get his team out of trouble on the counter-attack.<br><br>“I think he serves that purpose. If I was Liverpool, if I was Newcastle, all of those teams, I'd be all over him to try and sign him.”</div></body></html>
