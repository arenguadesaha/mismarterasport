Joe has been at the MEN since 2018, covering Manchester United in that time as well.<br><br>Manchester City did what they needed to at Luton to stop their winless run and get their season back on track after a 'shake' Pep Guardiola said he felt was 'necessary'.<br><br>Guardiola had admitted pre-match that he doesn't know how he would turn City's form around, if he could at all, given it was unchartered territory. He had never taken City to a fifth game without a win in the Premier League. Their preparations were given a further, significant, blow at Kenilworth Road as Erling Haaland got injured with no definite timescale put on his return.<br><br>It looked like another difficult afternoon was in store as Luton took the lead on the stroke of half-time, but Bernardo Silva and Jack Grealish turned things around to record a much-needed three points. Guardiola was relieved after the match, and did not downplay the significance of the win.<br><br>ALSO READ: Two Man City players instantly looked better without Erling Haaland<br><br>ALSO READ: What Pep Guardiola told his players as Man City make point<br><br>After Elijah Adebayo's header in the second minute of two added on in the first half, City restarted proceedings and referee Tim Robinson quickly blew for half time. As the benches walked across the Kenilworth Road pitch to the dressing rooms, Guardiola was in animated discussion with fourth official Craig Pawson, pleading his case over something.<br><br>There had been a couple of debatable foul throws, while Robinson had annoyed both sides with some decision-making in the first 45 minutes. But as it turns out, Guardiola was more irritated by the officials' timekeeping, as he explained after the match that City should have been given another minute to respond to the goal after the stoppage for Luton's celebrations.<br><br>His exuberant reaction to City's second goal - indicating that Luton's handball shouts were incorrect as the ball in fact struck Julian Alvarez's chin - only added to Guardiola's involvement, and the manager was just as irritated with Ruben Dias for conceding a free kick in second-half injury time that invited late pressure for the hosts.<br><br>After securing the win, Guardiola appeared to berate Dias on the pitch, presumably for the late free kick, while he had an animated joke with Grealish, although there looked to be a serious point he was making to his match-winner.<br><br>At half-time, Guardiola was calmer, though. He insisted that City didn't feel sorry for themselves. He told his forwards to be sharper in attack - Jack Grealish should shoot with his first touch rather than slow it down, and Bernardo Silva 'has to score' when he gets the chance. Both listened to the advice and scored the winning goals.<br><br>If Guardiola is keeping his head when the temptation would be to feel everything was going against City when Luton scored, the Blues are in a good place to build on their win and continue bouncing back from their winless run. Guardiola said it was up to him to turn the form around, and his half-time team talk against Luton suggests he had the right words for the occasion. Only 48 hours earlier, he had doubted if he was capable of exactly that.<br><br>By picking up on something as small as added time for Luton's goal, that is also a sign he's aware of everything going on around him - not just his in-game tactics. After the game, he was back to demanding the very best of his players, even after a win.<br><br>After a week of doom and gloom, City have parked their supposed crisis and Guardiola's behaviour at Luton suggests they're ready to kick on again.</div></body></html>
