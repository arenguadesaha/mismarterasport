The 24 year old was sidelined for five months following knee surgery in November last year, but managed to play in Manchester City's final three Women's Super League matches of the season.<br><br>She made her comeback for the Lionesses in May, starting in the 6-0 triumph over Portugal at Wembley, before playing against Spain four days later. She has since been selected for England's 23-player squad for next month's Euros.<br><br>While Hemp acknowledged the frustration of her prolonged injury, she expressed satisfaction at having an international camp under her belt as she prepares to help the Lionesses defend their Euros title in Switzerland.<br><br>"When I first injured myself, the timeframe was not as long â€“ as in, it was about three or four months so I thought I'm going to get back for City, I'm going to try and help as much as I can until the end of the season and then obviously I'll be fit, hopefully, come the summer," said Hemp.<br><br>"But then the timeframe kept being extended. It got to a point where I was like 'right I really want to get back on the pitch now, what's happening'?".<br><br>"To then be fit just before and get a camp under my belt and get some experience back, obviously doing that at Wembley, there is no better place to do it."<br><br>Reflecting on her fitness concerns earlier in the year, Hemp shared: "So yeah I mean there was obviously points where I was like 'am I going to be fit for the summer'? But no better time to be back fit and raring to go."<br><br>After England's triumphant Euro 2022 campaign on home soil, where they defeated Germany 2-1 at Wembley to secure their first major silverware, Hemp has become an integral part of Sarina Wiegman's team. Having been a starter in every match of that tournament, she is aware of the heightened expectations as the Lionesses head to Switzerland as reigning champions.<br><br>Hemp acknowledged the increased pressure: "Obviously naturally there's an added pressure because we have been successful in the past. I think naturally as the game is growing, every team is getting better as well."<br><br>Discussing the challenge ahead, she emphasised: "We know going into this tournament that it's going to be tough. It's probably the hardest tournament that there has been so far."<br><br>With deep respect for the competition, Hemp stated: "We've got so much respect for every team going into it and we know it's going to be hard, but we also know we've got every player that's capable of winning it again and we're going to do our best to make sure that we're going to be the best versions of ourselves come the tournament."<br><br>Eagerly anticipating the upcoming championship, Hemp concluded: "So yeah, we're all really looking forward to it."<br><br>Here at The Manchester Evening News, we're dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester City coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don't miss out on the latest City news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
