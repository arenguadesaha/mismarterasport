Up front the duo of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap have been added, winger Jamie Gittens was recruited from Borussia Dortmund and the Blues boss also has the long-awaited arrivals of Estevao Willian and Kendry Paez to look forward to.<br><br>This has thrown a hint of doubt into the mix around existing options. Nicolas Jackson, Joao Felix and Christopher Nkunku have been part of recent departure rumours, meanwhile football.london understands Noni Madueke is line to move to Arsenal after a £52m agreement was struck.<br><br>And the transfer merry-go-round keeps on turning with for every one who goes out door at Stamford Bridge, another player is made the centre of rumours.<br><br>Emerging now are claims from Italy that Chelsea hold interest in French striker Kolo Muani, who spent the final part of the 2024/25 campaign and the FIFA Club World Cup on loan to Juventus from PSG.<br><br>The 26-year-old scored 11 goals in 54 appearances in the French capital following a mega €85m (£73m) move from Eintracht Frankfurt so fell out of favour. A short-term spell in Turin saw his fortunes change, almost matching his PSG tally at 10 goals in just 22 outings with the Old Lady.<br><br>Now Calcio Mercato suggest the Blues have gathered information from PSG about a possible transfer, promising to break the harmony in Europe if they were to steal the striker from under Juve's nose.<br><br>Following his good time in Italy, Kolo Muani has outright admitted: "I want to stay. I honestly feel very good here. I can play well and score goals. I'm happy, I hope I can stay."<br><br>PSG and Juve had made the promise between themselves to reconvene following the Club World Cup, for which it was agreed at the start of June the loan deal would cover.<br><br>The Serie A side are then said to want another season-long loan this time, complete with a high fee paid directly to Kolo Muani's parent club, an option to buy and his €9m (£7.8m) annual salary covered. The Ligue 1 club, on the other hand, are bartering for a permanent agreement €45m (£39m), or at worst a loan with an obligation to buy next year.<br><br>So, there are clear differences stopping Kolo Muani's wish from being granted and allegedly putting pressure on the situation are Chelsea, who could seek the striker for themselves.</div></body></html>
