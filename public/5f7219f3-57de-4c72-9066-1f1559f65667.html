More info<br><br>Marcus Rashford admitted he would like to play with Barcelona star Lamine Yamal last month.<br><br>Rashford fluttered his eyelashes at the Catalan club, but they seem to fancy another forward.<br><br>Luis Diaz has been heavily linked with a move away from Liverpool this summer and his name continues to crop up alongside Rashford's when Barcelona's transfer business is discussed.<br><br>Barcelona are in the market for a forward and Diaz and Rashford are both valued between £40million and £50m, although the similarities stop there between Diaz's situation at Liverpool and Rashford.<br><br>Manchester United are desperate to sell Rashford after his relationship with Ruben Amorim broke down, while Liverpool are hopeful of retaining Diaz amid talks over a new contract.<br><br>Diaz has admitted that he's open to a new challenge, though, and one of the most likely destinations for Rashford would be taken off the table if the Colombian international switched to Camp Nou.<br><br>Barcelona cannot afford to sign both players. Liverpool cashing in on an offer from Barcelona for Diaz would end Rashford's hopes of playing in La Liga and deny United a convenient £40m sale.<br><br>Liverpool winning the Premier League was bad enough for United supporters last season, but they could potentially block Rashford's move, which is important to unlock funds for Amorim.<br><br>However, the reports linking Rashford with a move to Barcelona are not going away and their sporting director, Deco, went on record about Rashford when he spoke to BBC Sport last month.<br><br>Deco insisted Barcelona will "not sell our best players". He said Barcelona were in the market for "two, three or four signings", without needing to enter the market "like crazy" thanks to a solid base.<br><br>And when asked if Barcelona's plans included the option of signing Rashford, or Liverpool forward Diaz, he added: "We have been focusing on renewing contracts, after that, we'll discuss players to come.<br><br>"Of course, these two players, like you mentioned, they are good but have contracts in their clubs, so we won't speak because it's not fair. But when you decide to go to the market, for sure, we find some names. In my opinion, we don't need to bring many players."<br><br>Deco continued: "When I speak with the agents of the players, everyone wants to come or stay. So this is important. The image of the club is still good. We are proud because Barcelona is still such a big club, and the way we are playing football makes players want to come."<br><br>In the meantime, Rashford has returned to Carrington to train on his own in the afternoons, despite the club granting extra time to the players who want to explore a departure.<br><br>Rashford is also without a squad shirt number after United decided to give the No.10 shirt to new signing Matheus Cunha. Some fans believe that was disrespectful, and others just want to see Rashford out the door.<br><br>Regardless of those different opinions splitting the fanbase, it's sad to see the most successful United academy graduate of recent times end his time at his boyhood club on a sour note.<br><br>Rashford will hope for a move to Barcelona to turn a negative situation into a positive, but Liverpool could have an influence this summer and essentially hurt United in the transfer window.</div>
