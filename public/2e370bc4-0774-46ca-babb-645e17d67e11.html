Not that anybody wasn't anticipating the Colombia winger having a major say in the Reds' record-equalling 20th championship triumph.<br><br>Instead, eyebrows were raised in how his impact was achieved, Diaz starting a third of the top-flight campaign playing as the central striker rather than on his more accustomed left flank.<br><br>But with two years remaining on his current contract, a difficult decision awaits Liverpool. Should they look to cash in on Diaz with his stock high, or would they be wise to offer a new contract to a player who will turn 29 next January? Our ECHO writers have their say...<br><br>At the age of 28, Liverpool have a player who is, theoretically, at his peak in Luis Diaz.<br><br>And having come off his most productive season to date with the Reds with 17 goals and 13 in the Premier League for the champions, those statistics very much prove that aforementioned theory.<br><br>Increasingly, though, for those tasked with governance of the top clubs, one eye is kept on the future and with two years left on his current deal, there is a decision to be had at Liverpool over Diaz.<br><br>From a performance perspective, the Colombia international has shown how vital he is to the Arne Slot project at Anfield and his leading of the line as a 'false 9' at times was inspired, considering it was a position he was very much learning on the job.<br><br>Speaking to Telemundo last month, Diaz explained that he was expecting to sit down and thrash out talks on a new deal saying: "From the first day I arrived, I’ve always been happy, calm, enjoying the football played at this great team.<br><br>"We’ll be talking about [a new contract], we’ll talk about it. For me, I would stay however many years it takes, it also depends on the club, everything."<br><br>For those hoping for an extended stay on Merseyside, it sounded promising but social-media posts from his partner, Gera, have been less encouraging. Her Sunday night upload was widely interpreted as a goodbye to supporters.<br><br>That being said, Diaz should not be discarded so easily. He has grown in importance in the Liverpool frontline under Slot and while he will be tasked with sharing left-wing-duties with Cody Gakpo next term, should he stay, he still has a vital role to play for the champions.<br><br>A mega-money move to Saudi Arabia might be enough to cash in and reinvest but anything less, particularly from a more frugal, cost-cutting Barcelona, should be dismissed in favour of keeping the former Porto man on board. An exit leaves the Reds with another recruitment problem to solve at a time when there may already be some upheaval with the likes of Darwin Nunez and Federico Chiesa.<br><br>Liverpool find themselves in a little bit of an awkward situation regards extending the contract of Luis Diaz. Had the Colombian been 26, it would have been a no-brainer to offer an improved deal given his contribution to the team and versatility across the front line.<br><br>And were Diaz in his thirties, the Reds would have qualms keeping him until the end of his deal and then allowing him to depart on a free transfer, similar to the exits of Gini Wijnaldum and Roberto Firmino.<br><br>Instead, the forward is somewhat in between, already in his expected peak years but most likely, if normal trends are considered, to be slightly beyond that at the end of any contract extension.<br><br>It means any team making an offer now would probably have to spend a decent whack to prise him away from Anfield in the knowledge he almost certainly has another good three years left in him. Barcelona and the Saudi Pro League have both been monitoring developments.<br><br>For me, it seems the right time to reluctantly cash in on Diaz's value but with a rather important proviso - that Liverpool have another versatile, younger forward lined up as replacement who at the very least can provide the one thing the Reds attack needs: pace. Otherwise, there should be no great desire to part ways with Diaz and weaken Arne Slot's attacking arsenal.<br><br>Both Liverpool and Luis Diaz will have a pretty big decision to make this summer.<br><br>With Diaz recently turning 28 and with talk of interest from Barcelona and Al Nassr showing no signs of slowing down, it seems almost certain that the Colombian will be penning fresh terms before the transfer window closes on September 1.<br><br>But whether those improved terms are signed at Anfield, where he currently has two years left to run on his current deal, or elsewhere remains to be seen.<br><br>Of course, after Diaz played a starring role in the Reds' Premier League triumph - returning 13 goals and seven assists - it would be foolish for Liverpool to actively try and offload the No.7.<br><br>But if one of the four Saudi Pro League clubs backed by the Public Investment Fund were to table an eye-watering bid for the forward, even at half of what Al Hilal are willing to pay for Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes, Liverpool would be wise to cash in.<br><br>On the other hand, Diaz would surely only stay at Anfield if he is offered a new contract. But with the player creeping closer to his thirties, it seems unlikely that the Reds would be willing to offer a package that reflects his rank at Anfield.<br><br>It's for that reason that a separation feels inevitable this summer.</div></body></html>
