However, MEN Sport understands this afternoon that a third bid has been submitted to Brentford and there is a confidence in the Reds' camp that this will be accepted.<br><br>If it is, that will be marked as a standout piece of business for United as they look to complete their strengthening of the attacking midfield position. For Mbeumo, this news will be music to his ears as there have been numerous reports that he is growing frustrated by the process dragging on.<br><br>United will hope that if/when the bid is accepted, the next stages of the process will be mere formalities as they attempt to get their man signed up in time for the pre-season tour of the United States. After that, will come the small matter for Mbeumo of choosing his shirt number for the forthcoming season and beyond.<br><br>Fortunately for the Cameroonian, his two favoured numbers are both vacant and available to him. Domestically, he has often chosen the No.19 shirt while internationally he wears the No.20.<br><br>Whichever route he decides to take, he will be following the path well-trodden by a couple of United icons. The No.19 shirt, for example, was worn by Dwight Yorke during the sensational 1999 treble season.<br><br>While not synonymous with either man, both Edwin van der Sar and Marcus Rashford donned the shirt number when they were first making their mark at the Theatre of Dreams. Rashford's seemingly inevitable exit from United and the manner in which it has unfolded may sting now but over time his breakthrough into the first team will likely be lauded.<br><br>However, should Mbeumo choose the No.20 shirt he would follow in the footsteps of a player who also traded the capital for the north west but perhaps under more controversial circumstances. Robin van Persie made the shirt his own during his time with the Reds and will always be looked back upon fondly after trading Arsenal for United.<br><br>Of course, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Mbeumo may go for a different number. The No.14 is currently available should he fancy a change but whichever he decides to choose, the same expectations will be thrust upon him.<br><br>Here at The Manchester Evening News, we are dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don't miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
