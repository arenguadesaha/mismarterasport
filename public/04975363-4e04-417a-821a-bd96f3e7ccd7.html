          <h1>Giorgi Mamardashvili makes Alisson Becker claim as former Liverpool coach's role in transfer emerges</h1>
          <div>Giorgi Mamardashvili has welcomed the challenge of dislodging Alisson Becker as Liverpool's number one goalkeeper after making a first appearance for his new club. Mamardashvili played the first half for the Reds in their opening pre-season 3-1 friendly win at Championship side Preston North End on Sunday afternoon.<br><br>The 24-year-old Georgia international arrived at the club at the start of the month after Liverpool had agreed a Â£29million deal with Valencia last August.<br><br>Alisson has been the undisputed first-choice between the sticks for Liverpool since signing from Roma seven years ago, although he has been sidelined by various injury problems for spells in each of the last two seasons.<br><br>And while acknowledging the Brazilian's continued impact, Mamardashvili wants to write his own name in the lengthy annals of Anfield goalkeeping history.<br><br>"What I can tell about Ali, he's one of the best goalkeepers in the world right now and I am so happy to work with him," he said. "I can't wait to start to work (with) him and learn from him.<br><br>"Of course it will be a challenge (to provide competition). I like challenges and I'm here to just give my best and help the team."<br><br>Mamardashvili added: "I am happy, I am very excited to be here. It's a huge moment for me because joining a club like Liverpool, it's not only a transfer, it's a dream come true for me. I feel ready, motivated and proud.<br><br>"When I agreed (to) Liverpool's offer last summer, I felt that something big was beginning in my life. I watched all the games (on television last season) with a different feeling, like I was already part of the team. But now I truly understand what it means to be Liverpool's player.<br><br>"When I was a child I always watched some videos on YouTube of goalkeepers, and I remember some Liverpool goalkeepers as well. I remember Jerzy Dudek and then Pepe Reina and now Alisson Becker. Liverpool has a big goalkeeper legacy and I want to try to write my own chapter in this goalkeepers' legacy."<br><br>Among those Mamardashvili worked with at Valencia was former Liverpool goalkeeping coach Jose Manuel Ochotorena, who joined the Reds along with Rafa Benitez in 2004 before leaving three years later when replaced by Xavi Valero, who this summer has returned to his old role at Anfield.<br><br>And Mamardashvili has revealed the message he was given by Ochotorena when interest from Liverpool became apparent.<br><br>"Ochotorena is an amazing person and an amazing coach," said the Georgian, speaking to LFC TV. "Actually, he was one of the first who I talked (to) about Liverpool's offer and he directly told me 'just sign the contract' because he knows how big (a) club Liverpool is, and I just want to tell him thank you.<br><br>"I don't like too much talking about myself, but I think I'm a very calm, concentrated goalkeeper and I'm very fast and quick in the goal.<br><br>"I know the responsibilities that come with wearing this (Liverpool) shirt. This badge means so much to so many people. I'm here just to give my best in every training session, every match to help the team and earn the trust of our fans."<br><br>Sunday's game at Preston was Liverpool's first since the death of Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva following a car crash in Spain earlier this month.<br><br>And Mamardashvili said: "When I first arrived here it was a really tough moment for the club. But everyone here has supported each other and I see here is like a big family. We are not just a team, we are people who care about each other.<br><br>"I didn't have a chance to play with him but I played against him at Euro 2024, so I saw how amazing (a) player he was. I saw stories and messages and the love from people around him. I can see how amazing (a) person he was as well off the pitch."</div>
