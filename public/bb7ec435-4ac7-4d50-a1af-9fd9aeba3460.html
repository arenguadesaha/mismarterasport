Where am I going to go? I’m going to have to go back to playing with the boys’ team’.<br><br>“I think a lot of the girls did that and I was lucky to go back to the same boys’ team that I used to play with at North Walsham and in the end it shaped me to the player I am.<br><br>“One of the girls I played with at Norwich City, Flo Allen, advised me that Bristol City was a great place to go and I lived with her and a couple of other girls who played for Bristol City with a host family.<br><br>“My parents stayed in Norfolk, but they would come and watch the games now and again.<br><br>“It was nice being in a house with other players and people in the same position as you because then we didn’t feel lonely being away from our families.”<br><br>Hemp stormed her way to win England Young Player of the Year award in 2017, but she was still not signed on to a professional contract.<br><br>Her England career had already taken off at youth level by that point too, and Hemp admitted she did not see football as anything more than a hobby to have alongside a full-time job.<br><br>She said: “When I was younger, I still didn’t realise that it could be a career for me. It probably wasn’t until I was about 14 or 15 that I could then see the likes of Jill Scott, Ellen White and Kelly Smith going on to succeed and making a living out of it.<br><br>“Even when I went to Bristol City, the players still had to have two jobs and you couldn’t make a living just off football alone.<br><br>“So, from a young age I just thought it was something that was a hobby and I will enjoy doing it while I have another job. Fortunately, it has turned out to be my career.”<br><br>Still aged only 18, Hemp was signed by Manchester City, under Nick Cushing, and moved to the North West a year after captaining England’s U17s in the UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship and has since scored nearly 70 goals for the club.<br><br>“Someone rang me, to this day I’m still not 100 per cent sure who it was," Hemp told Sportsmail. “They said, 'Look, City are interested in you, I’ve had discussions with Nick Cushing and they’re really keen to have a chat with you.'<br><br>“I didn’t think a team like that would be interested in me. I didn’t have a clue who this person was so I told my mum.<br><br>"Next thing I know, she’s rang Nick and got him on the phone. She said, 'Is this genuine? Lauren has just had a call' and he said, 'Yeah, it’s completely genuine'.”<br><br>Hemp made her senior England debut in 2019, coming on as an 86th-minute substitute for Beth Mead in a 1–0 friendly win against Portugal.<br><br>And the young star turned her Olympic dreams into a reality in 2021 when it was announced she would be part of the Tokyo 2020 Great Britain squad under Hege Riise.<br><br>Tokyo 2020 redemption and café murals<br><br>Great Britain’s 4-3 loss after extra time against Australia at Tokyo 2020 stoked the fire for Hemp at the 2023 World Cup and she would have her revenge two years later with a goal and assist in the Matildas' backyard.<br><br>“I feel like I came into this competition with so much belief,” she told ITV after the semi-final win. “And I just want to be fearless, I just want to show what I can show on the world’s biggest stage.”<br><br>Her player-of-the-match performance was heralded by all and the 2022 Euros ‘One to Watch’ is far from a breakout star ahead of the 2025 edition in Switzerland but already a well-established one.<br><br>In her hometown, North Walsham, Café Kitale has a 22.9ft (7m) high mural of Hemp spraypainted onto its red brick and black panelling.<br><br>North Norfolk District Council launched an investigation following complaints about the image, which was commissioned by the café’s former owner, but it was determined that no further action would be taken.<br><br>Hemp told North Norfolk news, “It's nice because every now and again I'll get friends from home being like 'I just drove past you on the way to Sainsbury's' and things like that.<br><br>"I'm surprised there isn't a moustache or something over my face but my mum texts me most days and says: 'It's okay, it's still there - you've not got a beard yet.'<br><br>"It's nice and I can't wait to go home to see what it looks like in real life.”<br><br>Norfolk’s very own local legend has all the tools at her disposal to create more history with England after starting in every game of their run to Women’s Euros glory three years ago.<br><br>The biggest ‘what if’ moment of England’s 2023 Women’s World Cup final against Spain in Sydney, Australia came when Hemp – who had scored three goals in the tournament – struck the bar with a fierce effort in the 16th minute.<br><br>Instead, it was the Spaniards who took home the trophy following a 1-0 victory but it was Hemp – an astonishing four-time winner of the PFA Women’s Young Player of the Year award – who came closest to rattling them.<br><br>She continued to shine at Manchester City, becoming the youngest player to score 50 WSL goals when she struck against West Ham in October last year.<br><br>By this point, she had already helped the Lionesses qualify for the Women’s Euros, with her two assists in the 2-1 away victory over France – their first opponents in Switzerland – proving particularly crucial.<br><br>However, her 2024 ended with surgery on a knee injury that ended up ruling her out for five months, with City’s season faltering in Hemp’s absence.<br><br>She thankfully has looked sharp since her return and will head into the tournament arguably fresher than some of her peers, which should serve as an ominous warning to opposing full-backs.<br><br>Hemp told PA Sport: “We've got so much respect for every team going into it and we know it's going to be hard, but we also know we've got every player that's capable of winning it again and we're going to do our best to make sure that we're going to be the best versions of ourselves come the tournament."<br><br>"So, yeah, we're all really looking forward to it."</div></body></html>
