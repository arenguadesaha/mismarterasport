A journalist with over a decade's worth of experience, he has worked at the ECHO since 2016.<br><br>Anyone searching for a clue as to the actual scoreline here at full-time of this rip-roaring, top-of-the-table clash would not have found help from the giant Anfield scoreboard. Rather than tell us it finished Liverpool 2 Arsenal 2, the screens instead immediately opted to remind us, if it was needed, that Arne Slot's side are in fact Premier League champions.<br><br>It's been an inescapable fact for the remainder of the division for the past fortnight and one that will grate on Arsenal more than any club, given it is they who have - theoretically at least - been the closest challengers.<br><br>For the second Sunday in a row, Liverpool dropped points to a London-based club and the fact they still remain a comfortable 15 points clear of their nearest rivals only further illustrates just how dominant a campaign it has been.<br><br>With six points still left to play for, it is still in the hands of Slot and players to ensure they secure the biggest crown in English football by the widest margin recorded in the Premier League era. It currently stands at 19, set by Manchester City’s centurions of 2018.<br><br>Victories over Brighton & Hove Albion and Crystal Palace could ensure the Reds take that particular record and while it might not be a driving force for a group of players whose place in the pantheon of greats is already secure, it is a statistic that should light the fire in Slot and his coaching staff.<br><br>Given there is little else left to play for, the head coach and his team might as well go all out to secure another slice of history and if the Reds boss is insistent that everything that happens now is done with a view towards next season, it would be fitting that the champions finish with a flourish.<br><br>At times here, it looked as though they were going to blow away the Gunners.<br><br>If some of Mikel Arteta's more recent comments have raised an eyebrow or two, it was something the Arsenal boss said about a game over a decade ago that remains a universal truth.<br><br>Speaking about a remarkable performance from Brendan Rodgers's Liverpool in 2014, Arteta famously branded Anfield as "a washing machine" for visiting teams when they are caught in the sort of spin that gripped them here in the first period.<br><br>And as the new Premier League champions tore their visitors apart in the opening 45 minutes, Arteta might well have been reminded exactly what he meant by that comparison.<br><br>A stunning first-half performance from Slot's side should have been sufficient here. The Reds scored goals from Cody Gakpo and Luis Diaz, just a minute apart, and that was merely a reflection of the Reds' excellence in a period when they could have scored four or five.<br><br>Had David Raya not been on hand to deny Diaz and Curtis Jones, either side of the quick-fire double, then Arsenal would have been sent packing with the sort of scoreline that would have encapsulated the general gulf between the two clubs this campaign.<br><br>But the visitors managed to reach the half-time interval with the contest still alive and the tactical tweak that saw Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard switch positions paid instant dividends, with the former heading the latter's cross to reduce arrears within minutes.<br><br>Trossard's guile and craft began to tell against Conor Bradley, who had been excellent in the first half, and as the Belgium international's influence grew on the game, the Gunners first got a foothold before becoming the side who were forcing the issue more.<br><br>Bradley will be entrusted with the right-back berth for the remainder of the season now Trent Alexander-Arnold’s end-of-contract intentions have been made public. And while the Northern Ireland international showed glimpses of why he is rated so highly around these parts, the real story of this game, sadly, was about the man he will replace in the team next season.<br><br>Arriving as part of a trio of substitutes with a little under 25 minutes to play, Alexander-Arnold might have hoped his colleagues would act as ample coverage from the brick bats.<br><br>But perhaps to the shock of more than a few inside the ground and watching around the world on television, the vice-captain was subjected to the sort of angry reception that surely cannot have been inflicted on many others across this club’s entire history.<br><br>Even Roy Hodgson, during an ill-fated and gaffe-riddled few months in charge as manager, was only subjected to sarcasm from a fanbase who mockingly talked up his England job prospects during his lowest ebb on Merseyside.<br><br>El-Hadji Diouf was an expensive flop who brought shame on the club with some of his antics and even the Senegal star was spared this sort of baying mob.<br><br>The boos for Alexander-Arnold were, in that sense, so jarring, even allowing for his controversial decision to leave to join Real Madrid as a free agent.<br><br>If his introduction was audible enough, his first touches were greeted even more vociferously and in the haze of confusion around it all, Arsenal profited, forcing their equaliser through Mikel Merino as everyone at Anfield still struggled to work out how to feel. Many who jeered will tell you they already know where they stand, at least.<br><br>The stage was set for Alexander-Arnold to win it late on after Merino had been dismissed for a rash challenge on Diogo Jota when losing the ball on the edge of the box. The future Real Madrid man could only curl the free-kick wide, though, meaning match-goers were spared a truly surreal moment of deciding whether or not to actually celebrate.<br><br>The hope now must be that the melodrama is put to bed. For those who feel the West Derby-born star has committed a cardinal sin by defecting to the Bernabeu, indifference, reluctant acceptance and even apathy must now replace the anger and frustration, if only for the sake of truly enjoying the end-of-season festivities that the scoreboard reminded us will be coming at full-time.<br><br>At the height of the speculation over Alexander-Arnold's future, there was a Premier League title to be won, so it would be a crying shame now if his decision to seek pastures new overshadows the fruits of that labour.</div></body></html>
