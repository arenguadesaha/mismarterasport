Manchester City gave them one of the shocks by exiting before the knockouts, but not before they had taken part in a blockbuster play-off match with Real Madrid.<br><br>Paris Saint-Germain needed a comeback victory over City to avoid crashing out at the group stage but recovered magnificently to knock out Liverpool - who had finished first of the 36-team initial phase - before beating Villa, Arsenal and Inter to claim their first European Cup. And while the minnows struggled to avoid being taken apart, they enjoyed being in it and should improve the more they are invited.<br><br>For next season though, there are already changes. UEFA have changed the seeding system, meaning that only the top two from the league stage are guaranteed to play the second leg at home right through to the semi-finals.<br><br>However, if they are knocked out at any point, their conquerors will assume that advantage. If it had worked last season, PSG would have played the second leg of their quarters and semis at home having knocked Liverpool out in the last-16.<br><br>That is good news for first, second, and anybody who has to face them in the competition. But it means that the teams that finish third and fourth in the league phase are guaranteed not to have home advantage if they make it to the semis.<br><br>That could lead to a more dramatic end to the group stage even if teams have already qualified for the knockouts, since the final position of the top two or top four could come down to a goal or a point. If a team cannot finish in the top two, third or fourth may not be as good going forward as a position lower down the ladder.<br><br>Such strategy is something that City simply cannot afford to think about at this stage though. The sobering reality for Pep Guardiola and his players after last season is that they have to start from the bottom of the mountain again before thinking about the top.<br><br>Asked before playing Real Madrid if it was unfortunate to land such a European giant in the play-off, the manager said that any team they faced would have given them problems. After their comprehensive defeat, Guardiola reflected that the defeat didn't hurt like previous years before this time they had comfortably been second best.<br><br>City's boss did note how unlucky Liverpool had been to top the 36-team group and then have to play PSG in the last-16, but his team are a long way from being able to strategise in the competition. As they look to find their best selves again, Guardiola and his players really will have to take things one game at a time until they stop suffering such regular setbacks.<br><br>Kevin de Bruyne is one of - if not the - greatest players to play for Manchester City.<br><br>He leaves the club having won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, five League Cups and a memorable Champions League victory!<br><br>To mark his amazing time at the Etihad Stadium, this special edition has been produced - KDB The King - to celebrate Kev's career with the Blues. We look back at his 10 best games in Blue, celebrate his title wins and hear from the City boss and a host of team-mates and football elite who give their views on what makes him so special.<br><br>Here at the Manchester Evening News, we’re dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester City coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don’t miss out on the latest City news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
