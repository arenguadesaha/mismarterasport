However, Paez is set to leave on loan in the coming weeks, while there is an acceptance Estevao will need time to settle in England.<br><br>Noni Madueke has all but completed a move to Arsenal for £52million, while Jadon Sancho's loan spell has come to an end and Christopher Nkunku remains on the transfer list. Nicolas Jackson has also been strongly linked with an exit from Chelsea this summer, with Marc Guiu expected to depart on loan before the window closes.<br><br>With multiple players having left already, or expected to do so in the near future, the west Londoners are still open to adding another attacking option this summer. Chelsea would likely prioritise a left-sided attacking player, with Alejandro Garnacho and Morgan Rogers both options for the Blues.<br><br>Garnacho emerged as an option for Chelsea in the January transfer window but the Blues decided against making any moves for a left winger midway through the season. The Argentina international is said to be seeking a move away from Manchester United this summer and Chelsea are keeping a close eye over his situation.<br><br>Meanwhile, Rogers is another target for the Blues. Aston Villa do not want to sell the 22-year-old attacker, who scored eight goals and provided 11 assists for Unai Emery's side in the Premier League last season, but are reportedly willing to do business if a fee of at least £80million arrives their way as they look to put themselves in a stronger position PSR-wise.<br><br>Chelsea, though, are unlikely to do business as such an extortionate price, meaning Villa may well keep Rogers beyond the summer window. Either way, if Chelsea are not able to sign a left-sided attacker before September 1, then Tyrique George proved last season that he is more than capable of adding a threat to Maresca's attack.<br><br>Chelsea are FIFA Club World Cup champions. To celebrate, the club has launched a new collection with t-shirts, hoodies and more, including the 2025/26 Home Shirt with 'World Champions 25' printing.</div></body></html>
