He joined the MEN sport desk in 2013 and has covered City home and away since 2016, reporting on Pep Guardiola's time at the club.<br><br>After more inquests than Pep Guardiola would like over the last few days, the verdicts on Manchester City started coming in at Luton in under 90 seconds.<br><br>"F*** me, look how they pass," one fan said to his mate just after kick-off. The Premier League new boys have already seen Liverpool and Arsenal at Kenilworth Road but it didn't take long for the champions to be looked on as the best side to have graced the ground this year.<br><br>Guardiola's side did look miles better than they were allowed to be on Wednesday night on Villa Park, and improved on other recent performances. The problem was that the performance still nearly led to another unwanted result.<br><br>ALSO READ: Man City player ratings vs Luton as Nathan Ake good<br><br>ALSO READ: Erling Haaland injury blow for Man City before Luton fixture<br><br>Elijah Adebayo's header in first-half stoppage time might have made for a famous 1-0 win for Luton that asks further questions of a City team. That first half showed that you can play as well as you like but if you don't convert your possession into goals and stop opposition teams from scoring you can easily lose football matches.<br><br>City had played well, dominating the ball and forcing Thomas Kaminski into a number of good saves with Phil Foden particularly bright in an attack missing the injured Erling Haaland. However, when half of the team failed to stop Ross Barkley escaping their attention and the defence allowed Adebayo to rise highest in the box the second half became another test of a new-look City desperately trying to prove they still have the mentality of previous title-winners.<br><br>That they had to do it without Haaland was another symbol of City's struggles though, the rain pouring on them long before it fell on Sunday. The Blues should have been boosted by the return of Jack Grealish and Rodri to the starting lineup, but injury to Haaland, the continued absence of Jeremy Doku and the benching of John Stones turned an expected positive into another issue.<br><br>It can't be an excuse, but if anyone is looking for why City are below their best currently a good place to start is the absence of Stones, Kevin De Bruyne and now Haaland and Doku from the matchdays. Mateo Kovacic looked rusty on his first league start in over a month while Josko Gvardiol was again up and down from left-back.<br><br>Small margins are also going against City. Ruben Dias saw the ball deflect in off him at Villa Park and then could only blast the ball against the crossbar on the hour mark as City pushed for an equaliser.<br><br>Guardiola has been at a loss to explain some of City's winless run because he hasn't seen a lot wrong with the team - Villa Park, aside - and the feeling has been that those small margins will turn in their favour at some point. Four minutes at Kenilworth Road gave hope of a rainbow at the end of the rain.<br><br>First, Bernardo Silva swept home into the bottom corner after a number of fine advantages played by referee Tim Robinson. City were rightly angry about the Simon Hooper decision against Tottenham but good officiating needs to be shouted about as well.<br><br>As Luton were still recovering, a pass back to their defence bounced off the chin of Julian Alvarez and Foden pushed it back into his path for the Argentine to square to Grealish to fire through Kaminski's legs. Even more impressive than the quick goals was the reaction between them, City haring back to their half to restart the game rather than celebrating getting back into it.<br><br>This was City doing what has given them results in the past, and getting rewarded for it. It is just hard to see that they had strayed too far from that platform either in the first hour against Luton or in recent draws.<br><br>So much analysis around this team can seem dependent on the result and past form that you could interpret the final 20 minutes however you wanted. City either struggled to exert their usual control as Luton sought an equaliser, or hung on and did enough to claim a valuable three points.<br><br>Equally, to the performance as a whole was it a step in the right direction or more evidence that City are coming up short in both boxes compared to their usual standards? Both may well be true.<br><br>Ultimately, what matters is that City got out of their rut and have three points to accompany that winning feeling. Aston Villa's win over Arsenal has added to the feeling that an increase in the number of title contenders will mean fewer points are needed for the title, and to say the Blues had gone without a win in four they are only four points off the top ahead of the halfway mark in the league.<br><br>As this game showed, the team are still very much fighting for their aim. Rodri led the fury whenever mistakes were made, while John Stones and Manu Akanji were both brought on to protect the lead amid the inevitable onslaught from the home team in the final minutes; goalkeeper Kaminski even joined the attack for a 97th-minute corner but the Blues hung on.<br><br>If it was seen as a title-winning quality that Liverpool salvaged a draw here, or that Arsenal won a topsy-turvy game 4-3 this week, then City's comeback also has to be seen in that light. As much as results can mask performances, sometimes they are the most important thing for mood.<br><br>Luton may not see a better team this season, but City know that the best in the land are the ones holding the trophy in May. This game showed the work still needed if they are to fight off more challengers than ever for their crown, yet the three points may prove more decisive than anyone expected.</div></body></html>
