In total, £211million has left Stamford Bridge to acquire these new additions. There have also been a few outgoings in west London, with the likes of Djordje Petrovic, Bashir Humphreys, Kepa Arrizabalaga and Marcus Bettinelli all departing the club on permanent deals.<br><br>Between now and the end of the transfer window, there are set to be many more outgoings. The likes of Ben Chilwell, Axel Disasi, Raheem Sterling, Joao Felix, Renato Veiga, Lesley Ugochukwu and Armando Broja are all up for sale in the market this summer, football.london understands, as Chelsea's priority now switches to offloading players instead of bringing them in.<br><br>That is not to say Chelsea will not be signing anyone else this summer. That is not the case at all with the Blues looking to bring in numerous additions still, but the club's attention has temporarily turned to selling the unwanted players.<br><br>Chelsea are FIFA Club World Cup champions. To celebrate, the club has launched a new collection with t-shirts, hoodies and more, including the 2025/26 Home Shirt with 'World Champions 25' printing.<br><br>Chelsea are still looking to add another defender to their ranks before the start of the 2025/26 season and Jorrel Hato from Ajax has emerged as a concrete option. The 19-year-old's talents are admired by the Blues, who also like the fact Hato can play both as a left-back and in the centre of defence, especially given the lack of cover for Marc Cucurella for the majority of the 2024/25 campaign.<br><br>Elsewhere, bringing in another attacker has not been ruled out either. Alejandro Garnacho's situation could be one to keep an eye on over the next month-and-a-half. The Argentina international is expected to leave Manchester United this summer and the Blues are very fond admirers of the 21-year-old's talents, despite already bringing in Gittens and Joao Pedro, the former an out-and-out left winger and the latter a versatile forward who can play on the flank.<br><br>Morgan Rogers is another player Chelsea have an interest in. The Aston Villa attacker has been watched for a while by the Blues, though his current employers are reportedly asking for £80million if Rogers was to leave - a price the west Londoners would be hugely reluctant to pay this summer.<br><br>Meanwhile, despite earlier interest in Mike Maignan, a goalkeeper is unlikely to be signed between now and the end of the window, football.london understands. Robert Sanchez finished the 2024/25 campaign off in strong form, while Filip Jorgensen provides an adequate back-up option to the Spaniard.</div></body></html>
