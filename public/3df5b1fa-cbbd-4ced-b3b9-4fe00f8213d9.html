Under Unai Emery's watch, he has made 70 appearances, scoring 17 goals and providing 16 assists.<br><br>In both the Premier League and Champions League he appears to have found his level and Chelsea - returning to Europe's elite competition next term - might benefit from the England international's influence if they are to soon lose the spark Noni Madueke provides when the winger wraps up a £52m move to Arsenal.<br><br>So, there looks to be space and the funds in place to further enhance Enzo Maresca's squad in time for their return following a well-deserved three-week holiday.<br><br>Also going for Rogers is his connection to the Manchester City academy, along with good friends Cole Palmer and Liam Delap, and of course the Blues' boss himself.<br><br>So, football.london analyses the latest reports on Rogers ahead of a potential mega-money transfer before the next deadline passes.<br><br>According to talkSPORT, Chelsea's 'dream' of signing Rogers this summer may have to remain as such.<br><br>Villa are labelled as reluctant to do business for a star who has broken into Unai Emery's team with such confidence at a young age. In reporter Alex Crook's words, the 22-year-old is 'off limits'.<br><br>Now, the situation is tense as it is suggested the Midlands club will have to sell one of their players in order to comply with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), though they are likely to achieve this through letting Jacob Ramsey leave instead of Rogers.<br><br>football.london says: Nothing less can be expected of Villa - Rogers is a player they could shape their project around for the best part of the next decade. This is Chelsea we're talking about though, they're not easily ignored when they come calling and if any interest was established it would be interesting to see the player's reaction. The Blues have showcased how this side is ready to win trophies, but would Rogers want to risk the move a year before the World Cup?<br><br>Speaking on the London is Blue podcast, Matt Law of The Telegraph has suggested Aston Villa moving to sign Nicolas Jackson would kick Chelsea into gear for Rogers, but the only feasible way the former can move is for Ollie Watkins to depart Emery's squad.<br><br>"I'm not told by anyone at Chelsea but I'm told by people on the outside that if Villa do go for Nicolas Jackson, it will immediately trigger a bid for Morgan Rogers from Chelsea," Law explained.<br><br>"Obviously, Unai has worked with him and kind of promoted Nicolas Jackson in many ways, didn't want to sign another striker.<br><br>"The only way I see Villa going for Jackson is if Ollie Watkins goes, because I just don't, with us (Villa) not in the Champions League next season, see a scenario where we carry Jackson along with Watkins."<br><br>football.london says: Put like this, it makes it sound a whole lot harder to land Rogers before the summer is up. Watkins leaving Villa Park is nowhere near a guarantee, other than links to other clubs there is nothing concrete saying he will move now. Then if negotiating in tandem over Jackson and Villa's attacking midfield star, that situation will have many moving parts that could take time or go wrong.</div></body></html>
