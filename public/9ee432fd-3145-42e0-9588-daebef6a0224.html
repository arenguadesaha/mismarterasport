Barnet have traded places with the Brunton Park after clinching the National League title last season.<br><br>Mapping out his ambitions for the upcoming season, Hugill told Barnet's club website: "I think it's just obviously playing a lot of games, scoring a lot of goals is the main thing for a striker, but I'm still pretty young – still 21 – so I think it's just getting the games under my belt and having a really good season."<br><br>Bees manager Dean Brennan added: "We've been after this type of player for a long time. Even though he's tall, his movements and attributes are all in behind.<br><br>"He's got pace, excellent finisher, very dynamic – we want him to look down the barrel of the goal. He's such an exciting player, he's like a Jamie Vardy/Michael Owen type."<br><br>Hugill's contract at Old Trafford is up at the end of this season, but United have the option to extend it by an additional year. The striker has become the fifth player to be sent out on loan by the Reds this summer.<br><br>Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.<br><br>Here at the Manchester Evening News, we're dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don't miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
