The forward made 131 appearances at Molineux before completing his £45m transfer to Liverpool in 2020.<br><br>Jota, 28, was travelling across Spain in the early hours of Thursday, July 3, when he was tragically killed in a road traffic accident alongside his brother Andre Silva, 25. Since the passing of the two Portuguese footballers, who played for Liverpool and Penafiel respectively, the world of football has come together to pay their respects and honour their memory.<br><br>Jota has now been inducted into the Hall of Fame at Wolves, the club he represented between 2017 and 2020 before moving to Anfield.<br><br>The Midlands club have explained in their announcement that such a 'rare and heartfelt decision' usually takes weeks or even months for the committee, chaired by club legend John Richards, to come to. Only 38 players or teams have been inducted into the Hall of Fame since its inception in 2008.<br><br>Richards said: "There is such a feeling of sadness and disbelief around this awful tragedy that we wanted to make this tribute of our own as soon as we could.<br><br>"Like everyone else, we’ve been stunned by events, and we remember what a wonderful player Diogo was for Wolves during that unforgettable promotion season under Nuno and our early years back in the Premier League.<br><br>"His record of 44 goals at Wolves, and then 65 at Liverpool as a Premier League title winner, speaks volumes. So many fans across the game – especially in Portugal after he helped them win the Nations League this summer – are feeling his loss deeply. We saw no reason to delay this decision.<br><br>"We hope it will bring a little comfort to those who were close to Diogo and Andre, and we trust Wolves supporters will understand that this gesture is made with real love and admiration, and also fully justified."<br><br>Wolves director of football administration Matt Wild added: "This is a moving gesture and one the club fully supports.<br><br>"Diogo was not only a phenomenal footballer, but someone who carried himself with humility and kindness throughout his time at Wolves, and will be sorely missed by all of us.<br><br>"His legacy here is etched into our history, and we are proud to see him recognised in this way. The response from supporters has been overwhelming, and this Hall of Fame honour feels very fitting."<br><br>Wolves have previously confirmed they are set to pay tribute to Jota and Silva at their next two home fixtures—the last friendly of the summer against Celta Vigo and their Premier League opener vs. Manchester City. Exact details will be announced soon.<br><br>Liverpool and Preston North End paid an emotional tribute at Deepdale last Sunday as Arne Slot's side played for the first time since Jota's passing.<br><br>The club have officially retired his No.20 shirt, a decision announced after consultation with Jota's wife, Rute, and their family - the first time this has happened in Liverpool's history.</div></body></html>
