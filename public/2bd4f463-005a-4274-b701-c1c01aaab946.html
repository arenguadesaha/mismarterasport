This gives Arne Slot a short period to complete any more transfers and trial them in the four remaining summer friendlies before the real test begins.<br><br>Embarking on their pre-season tour of Asia next week, the Reds have already been heavy spenders with over £200m committed to strengthening the champions' squad. The most high-profile signatures have been Florian Wirtz - a record-breaking £116m arrival from Bayer Leverkusen - plus full-back duo Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez.<br><br>Excitement is high for the youthful impact these stars can bring to Slot's team and so all feature in the ECHO's dream Liverpool starting XI to take on Bournemouth.<br><br>This would be a difficult decision for the manager who would more than likely have to sacrifice the starting places of Dominik Szoboszlai and Andy Robertson from his title-winning squad, plus Conor Bradley has staked a fine claim to that right-back berth.<br><br>Meanwhile, it is understood Liverpool are not done with the market yet.<br><br>As the ECHO reported on Thursday, the chase for Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike has ramped up significantly. In a matter of days the club have gone from opening talks with the Bundesliga club to coming to a personal agreement with the player himself.<br><br>To coincide, rivals Newcastle United have backed down and left a free run at the striker. Provided there are no mishaps, the 23-year-old stands a strong chance of becoming Slot's leading man, and he too enters our dream XI to take on Andoni Iraola's side.<br><br>There has been intrigue caused by Luis Diaz as the winger has been openly uncertain about where he will finish the summer. In tandem, links have emerged to who the Reds could recruit in the Colombian's place.<br><br>According to talkSPORT, it is believed preliminary conversations have taken place with Real Madrid over Rodrygo's possible move to Anfield.<br><br>You do not become a Los Blancos star at the age of 17 for no reason and eight years on, he is now a fully-fledged Brazilian international who could flourish in the correct setting. It may take some effort to usurp Cody Gakpo too, but Rodrygo's versatility may earn him a place in the ECHO's dream XI for August 15.<br><br>To facilitate the deals done already and those remaining by freeing up the relevant squad space, some Reds stars could depart in search of regular game time before the season starts.<br><br>Joining Caoimhin Kelleher and Jarell Quansah taking the next steps in their careers would be Ben Doak, Calvin Ramsay, Darwin Nunez, Harvey Elliott, Kostas Tsimikas and Tyler Morton.</div></body></html>
