According to The Athletic, Wright will move to north London for a fee of £200k plus add-ons.<br><br>Wright made his debut for Salford's senior team in January against Manchester City and went on to make two appearances in League Two. The teenager has been a prolific goalscorer at youth level and in Salford's B team and it's thought a move to an elite club could help him take the next step in professional football.<br><br>The 6ft 3in striker will be expected to split his football between Arsenal’s U18s and U21s next season. “I feel great, I’m ready," Wright said following his first team chances last season. "For all of us, it’s a fantastic opportunity. Just to be even playing games, let alone training with the first team.<br><br>"Getting the opportunity and gaining the experience and taking things back to the B team and academy where we can influence them and hopefully bring more and more up, hopefully bring more people through and get more debuts."<br><br>The agreement comes as Andrea Berta continues to try and seal the transfer of Viktor Gyokeres. Arsenal are set to fly to Singapore on Saturday and Mikel Arteta did want his new No.9 on the plane with the rest of the squad, but that now appears unlikely.<br><br>football.london reported earlier this week that Arsenal and Sporting had finally come to terms on a €73.5million (£63.7million) deal for the striker with €10million (£8.4million) of that fee in add-ons. However, while the overall price has been agreed, the structure and manner in which the add-ons are achieved are the final details that the clubs are trying to iron out.<br><br>It is thought that the Portuguese side reportedly want the add-ons to be near-guaranteed, whereas Arsenal would prefer more challenging criteria to be met. According to Portuguese newspaper Record, as quoted by Sport Witness, there had been no progress as of Thursday.<br><br>Arsenal are set to play AC Milan in their first pre-season friendly on Wednesday, July 23 before later playing matches against Newcastle and Tottenham. At this stage, it remains to be seen if Gyokeres will feature for the club during the tour.<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
