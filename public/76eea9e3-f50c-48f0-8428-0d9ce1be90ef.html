However, both clubs continue to negotiate how achievable the add-ons in that deal will be and their payment structure.<br><br>Arsenal want the Sweden international to fly out with the team for their pre-season tour of Hong Kong and Singapore on Friday. Gyokeres, though, could join up slightly later if finalising that deal extends over the weekend and into next week, with their first friendly against Milan not being until Wednesday.<br><br>Regardless of when the transfer goes through, the striker will seemingly have to forego his preferred shirt number as a welcome gift. Gyokeres has worn the number nine since signing for Sporting, but that belongs to Gabriel Jesus at Arsenal meaning the Gunners are unable to offer it out should the Swedish forward end up finalising his move.<br><br>The number 17 he wears on international duty is also already assumed by Oleksandr Zinchenko. That, however, could change this summer with the Ukraine international linked with an exit.<br><br>But a departure does not appear imminent, suggesting Gyokeres must settle for another number. There are several significant ones available, though.<br><br>The number 10 is vacant after Emile Smith Rowe joined Fulham last summer. Number 14, famously worn by Thierry Henry, is also unclaimed.<br><br>Eddie Nketiah was the most recent player to sport the latter, but was sold 12 months ago to Crystal Palace. Gyokeres also notably wore that number previously while on loan at Swansea City.<br><br>He has also pulled on the number 10 during under-23s matches for Brighton & Hove Albion, and when a teenager coming through at Swedish club Brommapojkarna.<br><br>Other options for Gyokeres include numbers 18, 20, 26 and 27. The choice remains open, but the primary focus for Arsenal is to finalise the transfer.<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
