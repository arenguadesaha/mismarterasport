However, key details were spared with new manufacturers adidas only taking over from Nike next month.<br><br>The Reds are set to work with adidas for the first time since 2012, having agreed what the ECHO understands to be a five-year agreement with the German sportswear brand. However, the wait continues for that partnership to reap its benefits as the club are officially tied to current manufacturer Nike until July 31, meaning pre-season friendlies vs Preston North End, AC Milan and Yokohama FM are all being played wearing the strip worn to win the Premier League title.<br><br>After the switchover date when August begins, adidas can begin a rollout of their new range to the players to show off in their final friendlies against Athletic Bilbao, the Community Shield vs Crystal Palace and the start of the new league campaign at home to Bournemouth.<br><br>Authentic and replica versions of the kit the likes of Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Florian Wirtz will also find their way into Liverpool's 19 global club stores, other retailers worldwide and of course online. It is often a highlight of the summer for fans to get their hands on the latest equipment.<br><br>For those eagerly waiting to get a first official glimpse of what adidas' new entry will look like, one has just arrived.<br><br>This week video game developer EA Sports - another brand partner of Liverpool's - released their first teaser for the upcoming EA Sports FC 26 game, launching on September 26.<br><br>At one minute and 48 seconds into the trailer, a close-up shot of Reds captain Van Dijk is shown. A caption on the screen reads: "Show us the new kits!" However, EA Sports' answer says: "Sorry, you'll have to wait," with the entirety of the Dutchman bar his head, neck, hands and knees pixelated to not give any information away about the as-of-now unreleased Liverpool home kit.<br><br>The only detail spared through the pixelation is the fact the 2025/26 home strip will be red - hardly groundbreaking news.<br><br>So, the wait goes on to find out the true details of the new kit, which has been part of much speculation and has been susceptible to 'leaks' over a long-term period.<br><br>According to Footy Headlines, the new home kit will see a change to a 'strawberry red' base colouring complete with white features similar white panelling features to the strip worn between 2006 and 2008. The template has been rolled out across many of adidas' clubs for the upcoming season, including Real Madrid, Juventus and Newcastle United.<br><br>The shirt is predicted to feature the modernised adidas logo, the Reds' liver bird crest, sponsors Standard Chartered's logo in white on the front and the three white adidas stripes along the sleeves.<br><br>Further 'leaks' suggest Arne Slot's side will be wearing a white away kit and a 'sea green' alternate shirt for their first year back with the three stripes.</div></body></html>
