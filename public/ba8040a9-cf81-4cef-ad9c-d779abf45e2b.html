Some of the seasons have seen them fall away towards the end, although last season saw Liverpool pull away earlier in the season.<br><br>The summer transfer window could play a big part in where the title goes at the end of the 2025/26 season. Both Arsenal and Liverpool have been active so far.<br><br>Arsenal will feel like the potential signing of Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres could go a long way to closing the gap on the Reds in the new season. The club had to play without a recognised striker for the final months of last season due to injuries to both Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz, despite that they were still able to secure a second-place finish.<br><br>As well as activity in the transfer window, one other change at Arsenal this summer could potentially be the difference between finishing as title winners or runners up again.<br><br>Carlos Cuesta’s exit from the Emirates Stadium has led to Mikel Arteta appointing a new assistant manager this summer. Cuesta left the club to take up the managerial role with Serie A side Parma.<br><br>Arsenal turned to Gabriel Heinze, who joined the club as Arteta’s assistant earlier this month. With pre-season now underway, images shared by Arsenal have given a small insight into his coaching style.<br><br>Images show the Argentine having what could be described as an ‘aggressive’ style of coaching. Pictures show him getting close to and into the face of the players and not being afraid to show them and tell them what he wants from them.<br><br>It seems to be the opposite style to the one the Cuesta brought to the table. The Spaniard came across as more of a confidant and a friend to the squad with a more gentle approach on the training pitch.<br><br>However, the shift in styles could bring about a culture change at the training ground and the Emirates Stadium. Bringing someone with a more direct style may have been the intention of Arteta to help get that extra few percent out of the players come the end of the season.<br><br>The change in culture could just be key come the crucial times in the campaign. It may just be the difference between a first and second place finish come May.<br><br>Mikel Arteta and Arsenal face a crucial summer transfer window if they want to push Liverpool and Manchester City for the title next season and you can stay up to date with every breaking news story, opinion and more...<br><br>By signing up to our newsletter here, you'll make sure you receive the best Gunners content including news, rumours, articles and fan opinions - direct into your inbox and all for free!<br><br>We also want to hear from you.
