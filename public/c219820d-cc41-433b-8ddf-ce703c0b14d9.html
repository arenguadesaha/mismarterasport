Despite two unsuccessful attempts, United are now understood to have reached an agreement with Brentford for Mbeumo.<br><br>And the comments of his previous manager with the Bees, Thomas Frank, will serve as a boost for Ruben Amorim if – or when – the new man arrives at Old Trafford. Last year, Frank, who has since taken charge at Spurs and attempted to sign his former player, claimed: "I'd buy him if I was at a bigger club.".<br><br>Frank has been backing Mbeumo to succeed for some time. After the striker missed a chunk of action two seasons ago due to injury, his manager's remarks spoke volumes that he believes the goalscorer can cut it anywhere. Mbeumo's contributions were sorely missed at the time while he was on the treatment table, reports the Mirror.<br><br>"He [Mbeumo] was our biggest miss for four months last year, even with [Former Brentford striker, Ivan] Toney out," Frank said. "He was our key player and has added another layer this season with five goals in six games."<br><br>He continued: "That's incredible and he's creating chances. He's a top player. I'm convinced he will play for a bigger club. I'd buy him if I was at a bigger club."<br><br>The transfer saga is proving to be less than ideal for United. It's understood that Ruben Amorim wants all his new signings in place before the team jets off to the USA next week for their pre-season tour.<br><br>So far, Matheus Cunha is the only fresh face at United. The club's previous offers for Mbeumo - £45m plus £10m in add-ons and £55m plus £7.5m in bonuses - was turned down by Brentford, who value Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals last season, above the £62.5m United paid Wolves for Cunha.<br><br>Former United defender Rio Ferdinand, speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, believes the protracted negotiations have been casting United in a negative light.<br><br>"[Mbeumo] has told Tottenham, he's told Brentford that he only wants to join Manchester United. So Man United and Brentford have to come together and find a way of... well, Man United have to find a way of meeting Brentford's valuation," Ferdinand said.<br><br>"I think Man United have to get this done. I think it's been in the news for far too long to get to a situation where you get to the end of the window and it doesn't happen.<br><br>"I think that would be a custard, egg on your face situation for Man United, unless they go and get someone else, another striker. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative? So, I'll be surprised if this deal doesn't go through, because Man United have been adamant."</div></body></html>
