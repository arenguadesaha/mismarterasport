MEN Sport understands the Reds have submitted an offer of £65m plus £5m in add-ons for Mbeumo and there is confidence in United's camp that this will be accepted.<br><br>For the Reds, it represents a significant outlay on players in the No.10 position having already splashed £62.5m on Matheus Cunha on the first day of the window. Since then, the plan has revolved around Mbeumo and his arrival cannot come soon enough.<br><br>While there is not a clamour to beat the deadline, time is of the essence to integrate Mbeumo into this United team before the serious stuff begins in mid-August against Arsenal. One of the ideal times to form these partnerships is during the summer pre-season tours and United's is just around the corner.<br><br>On Tuesday, July 22, the Reds are going to be jetting off to Chicago which shall be their temporary home for the Premier League Series. West Ham, AFC Bournemouth and Everton will be their opponents on a trip that will look to balance matches, commercial opportunities and team bonding all into one.<br><br>If United want Mbeumo to be there for the majority of that trip, they have just five days to get the deal over the line. Realistically, this is a tight turnaround as Brentford have not formally accepted the offer yet.<br><br>There is also the task of finalising Mbeumo's contract and completing the relevant medical tests which all take significant time. As we have seen in the past, players who sign during the tour have flown out to join their new teammates in the United States.<br><br>But, after a saga which stretches back to June, United will be hoping to get the transfer over the line as soon as possible.<br><br>Here at The Manchester Evening News, we are dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don't miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
