United triggered his £62.5million release clause and the deal was formally completed 11 days later.<br><br>In between confirming they had reached an agreement to sign Cunha and formally unveiling him as their first summer signing, United tabled an opening offer for Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo.<br><br>Alongside Cunha, the Brentford attacker was one of the best players in the Premier League last season, scoring 20 goals. United set an objective of signing him ahead of the start of pre-season training at the beginning of last week.<br><br>After seeing an opening bid worth £55m knocked back and a second offer in excess of £60m not proving enough for Brentford to give Mbeumo the green light to move to Old Trafford, United could have been forgiven for walking away. Instead, discussions are still ongoing.<br><br>United are determined to bring Mbeumo to Old Trafford and beef up their attack. They have rightfully prioritised attacking signings this summer and the prospect of heading on the upcoming tour of the United States with Cunha and Mbeumo in the bank would resemble a strong start to the window.<br><br>In addition to chasing Mbeumo's tail, United are still eager to sign a striker this summer. However, after missing out on Liam Delap, it remains to be seen who they will turn to in their pursuit of an out-and-out No.9.<br><br>Furthermore, United also want to sign a midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer. It remains to be seen if Andre Onana's hamstring injury will force them to move for a shot-stopper earlier than expected.<br><br>United's retained list confirmed the exits of three first-team players: Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen. Tom Heaton was the only out-of-contract player to be offered a new deal.<br><br>The exit of the aforementioned trio immediately shrunk United's squad size. It has now been reduced by a further five players amid Tyrell Malacia's, Marcus Rashford's, Jadon Sancho's, Alejandro Garnacho's and Antony's absences from first-team training.<br><br>The quintet have all informed United they want to leave the club and they do not feature in head coach Ruben Amorim's plans. With the exception of Garnacho, they all spent time away from Old Trafford on loan last season, with Malacia, Sancho and Rashford departing in the winter window.<br><br>United are right to try and sell all five of them amid Malacia's struggles and Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation having no room for natural wingers. Cunha has been drafted in to play as the left-sided No.10 and Mbeumo could be an option for the right-sided berth.<br><br>Having released three players and five more not currently training with the first-team, United's squad size is currently smaller than it was last season. However, they will play fewer games in 2025/26 after failing to qualify for Europe.<br><br>United could play as few as 40 matches in the coming season, meaning the demands will not be as straining as they have been in recent years. United played 60 competitive matches in 2024/25.<br><br>To ensure United strike the right balance between having a healthy number of options and enough quality in reserve, Amorim cannot afford to be left light in any area of the squad. With four attackers currently out of the picture and no guarantees about Rasmus Hojlund's or Joshua Zirkzee's future at the club, United face the prospect of being light up front.<br><br>The obvious caveat to highlight is that Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony are natural wingers and do not fit into Amorim's system, but they are still bodies Amorim could turn to in an emergency. They will, when analysing the landscape of the squad in terms of personnel, need replacing in some form.<br><br>If United can add Mbeumo to the ranks, he and Cunha will be first-choice No.10 options. Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Amad can also operate in those roles.<br><br>In terms of natural strikers, though, United still look light. Hojlund regressed in his second season at the club and Chido Obi is still raw and unproven, despite his exciting potential.<br><br>The club's striker search is yet to offer the answer they are looking for and that will only change once funds become available via player sales. Departures hold the key to completing what many consider as United's top transfer objective.<br><br>Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.</div></body></html>
