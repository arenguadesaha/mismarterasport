You can follow Steven on Twitter at @StevenRailston.<br><br>Manchester United play their opening pre-season friendly against Leeds on Saturday.<br><br>The first batch of United’s players returned to pre-season at Carrington on July 7 and they were joined a few days later by the players who were on international duty at the end of last season.<br><br>Ruben Amorim will oversee his first pre-season in charge of United this summer and will hope to lay the foundations for a successful campaign. Matheus Cunha will strengthen Amorim's attacking options and Bryan Mbeumo is expected to arrive soon after a third bid was accepted by Brentford.<br><br>Cunha will travel to face Leeds in Stockholm, Sweden, after adapting to his new surroundings at Carrington, and United want Mbeumo to be involved during the United States tour next week.<br><br>So what could the starting XI look like against Leeds? Youngsters are set to be named in the travelling squad and Amorim will likely make wholesale changes for the second half, but it makes sense to go strong from the first whistle.<br><br>The players who reported for pre-season at Carrington at the earliest possible date should be slightly ahead with their fitness and Amorim will pick his starting team with that in mind.<br><br>Andre Onana is currently recovering from a hamstring injury and won't be involved against Leeds, so Amorim will have a choice between Altay Bayindir, Tom Heaton and Dermot Mee. Bayindir seems likely to get the nod before one of his colleagues is substituted on.<br><br>Noussair Mazraoui, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven are the strongest back-three pairing from the players who returned to Carrington on July 7 and it seems logical to start that trio at the Strawberry Arena.<br><br>In the wing-back roles, supporters will be hoping to see Harry Amass and Diego Leon in action, but Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu will benefit from starting to get minutes ahead of the USA trip.<br><br>Kobbie Mainoo will be hoping to remind everyone of his talent this season and already looks in good condition. Mainoo could start alongside Bruno Fernandes in the pivot.<br><br>Amad and Joshua Zirkzee seem likely to start in attack, although the majority of Scandinavian supporters will be most excited to watch Cunha after his £62.5million transfer from Wolves. Cunha is an entertainer on the pitch and has the potential to become an immediate fan favourite.<br><br>United are also set to wear their new away shirt for the first time against Leeds in Stockholm. The kit is predominantly white and light lavender with dark purple accents.<br><br>Strongest XI vs Leeds: Bayindir, Mazraoui, De Ligt, Heaven, Dalot, Dorgu, Fernandes, Mainoo, Amad, Zirkzee, Cunha.</div></body></html>
