Kepa Arrizabalaga, Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard have all been involved in the preparations for the new season.<br><br>The team are due to fly to Asia on July 19 with some more potential signings expected to join. Cristhian Mosquera has been completing the final details of his deal from Valencia, whereas Noni Madueke will be entitled to a break and join the group later.<br><br>With that in mind, and the wait for Viktor Gyokeres ongoing, the latest images of the training have been released. As such football.london has sifted through them to see what gems of information we can glean from them.<br><br>Arteta has taken a large group of young players with him to Spain as they continue their own development, while some stayed behind in London Colney. Max Dowman was one; however, the latest group of images did not capture the exciting talent.<br><br>There were eight players who were with the group, including: Josh Nichols, Harrison Dudziak, Ismael Kabia, Maldini Kacurri, Andre Harriman-Annous, Louie Copley, Marli Salmon and Ife Ibrahim. Their under-21s coach Mehmet Ali has since left the club to join the senior Brentford coaching staff and the process to replace him remains ongoing.<br><br>One player who is with the group but has yet to get involved beyond rehabilitation, at least according to the images, is Jurrien Timber. The Dutchman underwent a procedure at the end of the season to repair an ankle problem but is hoping to get back playing ahead of the new season.<br><br>There were no images of Timber in the latest release and those that are available from five days prior only show the full-back doing fitness work and no ball work. Gabriel Magalhaes, however, appears to have stepped up his recovery and is doing ball work although there are yet to be images of the Brazilian in much other than minor drills.<br><br>There are a number of players on the trip who are being linked with a move away from the club. In this latest release, all of Albert Sambi Lokonga, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko were pictured and involved in the sessions.<br><br>However, after rumours linking Karl Hein with a move to Sevilla, there has been no sign of the goalkeeper. David Raya, Kepa, and Tommy Setford were all pictured, but the Estonian international was not snapped since the previous release five days earlier. This could be a potential hint as to discussions over an exit being under way, although certainly not definitive.<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
