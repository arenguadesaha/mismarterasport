However, Mikel Arteta seems to want to get in a quick match before the official scheduled friendlies kick-off.<br><br>Reports suggest that Arsenal will host a pre-season behind-closed-doors friendly at the Sobha Realty Training Centre on the same day the team will fly out to Asia. They are expected to play Watford, their neighbours who are housed at the club’s old training ground, a stone’s throw from the new complex where the Gunners have been for many years now.<br><br>Arteta has plenty of players to choose from and has spent time in Spain at a warm weather training camp in La Manga with the first team squad and several under-21 players too. The team to face Watford can feature many of the players who were on that trip.<br><br>Among those could be as many as four unofficial debuts. Max Dowman, the 15-year-old talent, is now able to make his Premier League debut because he turns 16 during the campaign with Arteta believed to be very keen to give the midfielder his chance.<br><br>Summer signings Martin Zubimendi, Christian Norgaard and Kepa Arrizabalaga could also all be involved too. Declan Rice, who did not travel to Spain and football.london understands has been following an individual training plan in north London, is not thought to be concerned and so he too could be involved.<br><br>Arteta tends to like to have two elevens in these games with many changes made at the half time break. It means potential opportunities for some other youngsters like Josh Nichols with Jurrien Timber still not fit enough to play.<br><br>Ethan Nwaneri is not quite back yet but is expected to return soon. In midfield could be a chance for Louie Copley who has just signed a brand new professional contract with the club alongside Dowman.<br><br>While we wait for the arrivals of Cristhian Mosquera, Noni Madueke and notably Viktor Gyokeres, swapping out with Kai Havertz could indeed be Mikel Merino who has offered his abilities in many different positions.<br><br>Arsenal behind-closed-doors first-half potential XI: Raya; White, Saliba, Gabriel, Lewis-Skelly; Zubimendi, Rice, Odegaard; Saka, Havertz, Martinelli<br><br>Arsenal behind-closed-doors second-half potential XI: Kepa; Nichols, Kiwior, Calafiori, Zinchenko; Norgaard, Copley, Dowman; Nelson, Merino, Trossard<br><br>Join our Arsenal WhatsApp channel and get all the latest breaking news, opinion, podcasts and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Arsenal writers straight to your phone!<br><br>By following this free service you will be the first to know the news from the Emirates Stadium as it happens, when it happens.<br><br>To join our dedicated Arsenal channel, all you have to do is click this link and you can join thousands of others following our Gunners coverage!<br><br>If you're curious, you can check out our privacy policy here.</div></body></html>
