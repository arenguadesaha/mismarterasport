Last week, though, the Blues agreed a big-money deal with Arsenal for the sale of Noni Madueke to at least recoup some of that.<br><br>The Gunners will pay £52million for Madueke, who is set to leave Chelsea after two-and-a-half years at Stamford Bridge. The £52million for Madueke will bring Chelsea's total sales figure to just short of £100million. And there is still plenty more to come on that front it seems.<br><br>The £52million alone, though, is set to help Chelsea in their pursuit of a new defender. As reported by football.london on Wednesday, the Blues are considering making a move for versatile Ajax defender Jorrel Hato, who is a much sought after figure this summer following an impressive season in Amsterdam.<br><br>Ajax are reportedly chasing £60million for the Netherlands defender, who said last month that he is in no rush to depart the Johan Cruyff Arena. "The smartest thing to do is to look at it per season," Hato said on his future. "That's what I do.<br><br>"Of course you want to achieve things in the end: the Champions League, a World Cup and a European Championship. I still have plenty of time. I don't think: 'I absolutely have to win the Champions League in two years'.<br><br>"In the Dutch league, you have to show how good you are against the big clubs. Ultimately I have to continue to develop the things I am already good at, so that it becomes top. How do I describe my time at Ajax? Ajax is home for me. I just feel at home here."<br><br>Having been on Ajax's books for the last seven years, it is no surprise Amsterdam feels like home for Hato. However, as so often happens with the Dutch club, they develop players before letting them leave for a sizeable fee. Chelsea will know that and that is why the Dutchman is one of the numerous defenders being considered at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Talks have been held for the possible signing of Hato, however Liverpool are also said to be keen on the versatile Dutchman. Chelsea appreciate Hato's versatility as he could potentially cover Marc Cucurella at left-back, as well as slotting into the centre of defence for Enzo Maresca.<br><br>Chelsea are FIFA Club World Cup champions. To celebrate, the club has launched a new collection with t-shirts, hoodies and more, including the 2025/26 Home Shirt with 'World Champions 25' printing.</div></body></html>
