However, the Reds will not entertain any sale during this transfer window unless they are given an offer that would be deemed impossible to turn down.<br><br>Diaz has cast doubt over his Anfield career with comments during the close season period, although he insists he would be happy to see out his contract at Liverpool.<br><br>When recently asked about where his future lies, he said: "We don’t know yet. We’re there talking with the management, we’re calm where I am. We’ll see what can be achieved, for us and for the club. We’ll try to do our best and make the best decision.<br><br>"We’re in the process of negotiations, talking with the club, with Liverpool, with everyone who’s approaching us. But I’m very calm where I am, you know, very happy. Trying to make the best decision now."</div></body></html>
