I just wouldn’t let him leave the garden until I won!”<br><br>Still aged only 10, Clinton caught the attention of Everton after their then-manager Andy Spence, who also ran the Toffees’ girls’ academy, scouted her playing in a tournament for her primary school.<br><br>Spence offered Clinton a trial, but her father felt at the time it would be better for her development to continue playing alongside boys for Old Xavs and her school.<br><br>It was at secondary school that things changed, however, with Clinton saying: “It only lasted another year because then we didn’t have a girls’ team because they didn’t have a coach, which was sad to be honest as you would like to have a girls’ team in every school ideally.<br><br>"So, I did the next best thing, like netball, basketball and things like that.<br><br>“That is why the work the Lionesses have done over the last year around accessibility in schools is so impactful.<br><br>“It is so nice to see so many girls involved with football at school now because I think there was only me and one or two other girls who carried on playing football. Now I think you would get a much higher number.”<br><br>Clinton finally went to trials at Everton at 12 years old and would end up staying with the Toffees for seven years.<br><br>It was after being called up to train with the senior squad that Clinton would get to see one of her future Lionesses team-mates up close and personal for the first time, with Chloe Kelly making her name at the club.<br><br>Clinton started out as a defensive midfielder but gradually moved forward as she developed as a teenager, which included rising through the England age groups.<br><br>She even had a spell playing as a centre forward in the 2022 European Under-19 Championships, by which stage she had already made her breakthrough at senior level.<br><br>After being an unused substitute for the 2020 Women’s FA Cup final, Clinton made her debut for Everton in a Merseyside derby against Liverpool in the Women’s League Cup in November 2020.<br><br>She went on to make 21 appearances for the Toffees before signing for Manchester United in the summer of 2022, although she would make her mark elsewhere in the next couple of years.<br><br>Before she had made an appearance for United, Clinton was sent on loan by manager Marc Skinner to Women’s Championship side Bristol City.<br><br>She thrived in the second tier, scoring six goals in 15 games including the opener in a 4-0 win against Charlton on the day the Robins secured promotion to the Women’s Super League.<br><br>Clinton was loaned out again in the 2023/24 season, this time to Tottenham Hotspur and it was in north London that she really began to stand out as a potential superstar.<br><br>One notable performance came against West Ham in January 2024 when she scored twice and provided an assist as Spurs won 4-3, while she played a key role in the club’s run to their first ever Women’s FA Cup final.<br><br>However, Clinton would be forced to sit out the showpiece at Wembley as Tottenham found themselves up against her parent club, rendering her ineligible, and she watched on as United won 4-0.<br><br>While that experience was bittersweet, Clinton had by this stage gone through the joy of making her senior England debut, after first being called up by Wiegman in October 2023.<br><br>Clinton told England Football about her call-up: “I had not spoken to Sarina before she rang me about the call-up – I had obviously seen her from afar and she always seemed like a cool woman.<br><br>“When she rang me, I actually missed the first two calls because the signal at my house is not great. Then when she rang back, it was through WhatsApp because of having wifi and I could see her profile picture!<br><br>“When I answered, I was expecting her to tell me I had been playing well and she was keeping an eye on me for the future so when she told me the news I had been called up, I was speechless.<br><br>“I was like, ‘Wow, I think I need a sit down and a cup of tea. Thank you’. She started laughing and said, ‘Yes, have a cup of tea’.”<br><br>Given how her campaign had gone, it wasn’t much of a surprise to see Clinton immediately make her mark at international level as she scored 19 minutes into her Lionesses debut against Austria in February 2024.<br><br>A stunning campaign for Clinton was rounded off by her being named PFA Women’s Young Player of the Year.<br><br>She told the PFA upon receiving her award: “To go out on loan, learning as a young player and being recognised is lovely.<br><br>“I’ve played with confidence and when you play with that then you see the best version of a player.“Tottenham have been a massive part of my journey, and I can’t thank them enough. Goals and visualisation are important to me but most of all just enjoying playing. If I’m enjoying myself then I play my best football.”<br><br>By this stage, Clinton was back with Manchester United, who had actually just endured a disappointing WSL campaign while she was on loan with Spurs, despite their Cup final triumph.<br><br>Clinton played a big part in helping United back up the standings last season, starting with a debut goal against West Ham at Old Trafford on the opening day of the season.<br><br>She eventually ended with nine goals in all competitions – her best season’s tally yet – as United finished third and qualified for the Women’s Champions League, with Clinton being named in the WSL’s Team of the Year.<br><br>She also managed to experience playing in a Women’s FA Cup final this time, although she was again on the losing side as United were swept aside by a Chelsea side completing a domestic treble.<br><br>She does, however, have dreams of lifting silverware with England this summer, as she is set to add to her 11 caps and three goals during the Euros in Switzerland.<br><br>Fran Kirby’s recent retirement from international football means there are several players competing for the No.10 slot in the Lionesses’ line-up, with Clinton one of the main contenders to fill it.<br><br>At first, it was about being better than her brother, and after developing into one of the best players in the country she can now set about being one of Europe’s elite.<br><br>The July 2025 edition of Women's Football News is available now.
