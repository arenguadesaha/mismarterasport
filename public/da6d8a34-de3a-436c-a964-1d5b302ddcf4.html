While the Italian is away on holiday, enjoying a well-earned rest, the Chelsea sporting directors must work overtime to ensure he has the tools to compete on all fronts next season.<br><br>Having already wrapped up the bulk of business, signing the likes of Joao Pedro, Liam Delap and Jamie Gittens, the Blues should be in the market for a luxury signing. Fortunately, Chelsea banked £84m from the Club World Cup, so there's no excuse not to bring in a marquee player.<br><br>Winstanley and Stewart mustn't get carried away though, with lots of players still to be offloaded – whether that's permanently or on loan. So, with that being said, football.london has looked at what Chelsea need to do to have the perfect transfer window.<br><br>Chelsea are FIFA Club World Cup champions. To celebrate, the club has launched a new collection with t-shirts, hoodies and more, including the 2025/26 Home Shirt with 'World Champions 25' printing.<br><br>Chelsea are well-positioned to compete on all fronts next season, but Maresca could do with three new faces in the squad: Mike Maignan, Jorrel Hato and Morgan Rogers.<br><br>Robert Sanchez earned his keep in the Club World Cup final, but that doesn't mean Chelsea should halt their search for a new shot-stopper. Last month, football.london understood that the west Londoners were willing to submit a £13m bid for Mike Maignan; AC Milan wanted in excess of £20m, so a deal collapsed.<br><br>The Italian giants could be inclined to reconsider Chelsea's offer. The 29-year-old goalkeeper has recently entered the final year of his contract at the San Siro so, from January, the Blues will be eligible to open pre-contract talks over a free transfer in 2026.<br><br>If Maignan doesn't sign a new deal, the Rossoneri will be forced to make a difficult call. Milan must decide whether they'd rather risk losing the France international for free at the end of the season, or cut their losses and cash in.<br><br>Neither Chelsea nor the Italian giants will concede hard-fought ground in negotiations, but a compromise should be possible. The Blues could also do with bringing in Hato as cover for Marc Cucurella.<br><br>The 19-year-old defender, who made his 100th appearance for Ajax in March, largely featured at left-back last season, despite having previously earned his stripes as a centre-half. Should Levi Colwill ever need a rest or suffer an injury, Hato could step in.<br><br>football.london understands that Hato is on Chelsea's radar, along with a few other defenders. There have been tentative enquiries about the Netherlands international from Stamford Bridge, with the Blues contacting the Dutch giants about a potential move.<br><br>It's understood that Chelsea view Hato's versatility as a massive green flag, and it's a key reason why they could explore a potential deal down the line. Once Winstanley and Stewart beef up Maresca's defensive options, they should take a look at Rogers from Aston Villa.<br><br>The 22-year-old attacking midfielder would be a significant upgrade on Noni Madueke, who looks set to join Arsenal this summer. Rogers could quickly establish himself as a starter on either flank, while also providing cover for Cole Palmer in attacking midfield.<br><br>Chelsea could make well over £150m in player sales this summer. Madueke, Renato Veiga, Benoit Badiashile, Axel Disasi, Ben Chilwell, Carney Chukwuemeka, Joao Felix, Christopher Nkunku, Armando Broja and Lesley Ugochukwu should all be offloaded as part of a mass exodus.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mike Penders, Kendry Paez, Marc Guiu, Aarón Anselmino, Mamadou Sarr, Caleb Wiley, Omari Kellyman and Gabriel Slonina should all go out on loan, whether that's to a Premier League rival or to Strasbourg.<br><br>Unless they can force themselves into Maresca's immediate plans, they should be given the chance to play regular first-team football. As much of a boost as it would be to keep them around, they – and the club – would be better off in the long run if they went out on loan.<br><br>Goalkeepers:Robert Sanchez, Mike Maignan (AC Milan) and Filip Jorgensen.<br><br>Defenders:Marc Cucurella, Jorrel Hato (from Ajax), Levi Colwill, Trevoh Chalobah, Tosin Adarabioyo, Wesley Fofana, Josh Acheampong, Malo Gusto and Reece James.<br><br>Midfielders: Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo, Romeo Lavia, Andrey Santos, Dario Essugo and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall.<br><br>Forwards: Nicolas Jackson, Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Cole Palmer, Morgan Rogers (from Aston Villa), Pedro Neto, Estevao Willian, Jamie Gittens and Tyrique George.<br><br>Want to keep up to date with the breaking and important Chelsea stories whilst on the move?
