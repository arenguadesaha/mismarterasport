Once a transfer is confirmed, United will be expected to go back into the market for further new additions.<br><br>The club know they'll need to offload a number of fringe players with the likes of Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho all available to leave Old Trafford this summer.<br><br>Spanish news outlet Sport have claimed that United are showing an interest in signing RB Leipzig star Xavi Simons. The report claims that the Reds will face competition from Chelsea and Bayern Munich for the Netherlands international.<br><br>It has been suggested that Bayern are the club most likely to sign Simons, due to them already actively looking at a deal for the 22-year-old. United are still said to be interested in a transfer, with the Dutch international reportedly keen to leave Leipzig before the September 1 deadline.<br><br>Despite United being handed this boost, the report claims that Leipzig's price tag for Simons is stopping a deal from progressing any further at this stage. Various reports this summer have claimed that the Bundesliga outfit value Simons at around €80million (£69.2million).<br><br>United have already signed a playmaker who can play in the No.10 position following the £62.4million arrival of Matheus Cunha from Wolves. It remains to be seen if United's reported interest in Simons turns out to be genuine, given his arrival would lead to intense competition for a starting spot alongside Cunha, while Mbeumo is also expected to play in the number ten position.<br><br>Here at The Manchester Evening News, we are dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.<br><br>Make sure you don't miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.
