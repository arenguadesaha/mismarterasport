Despite the scrutiny, Chelsea ended the 2024-25 season on a high note, securing a Champions League spot, triumphing in the UEFA Conference League, and then defeating European champions Paris Saint-Germain in a superb FIFA Club World Cup final performance.<br><br>Maresca has achieved these feats while the club's hierarchy continues to invest heavily in young talent, bolstering what is already the youngest squad in the Premier League. Newcomers Jamie Gittens, Liam Delap, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr, and £60million forward Joao Pedro have joined, with players such as Noni Madueke and Christopher Nkunku expected to leave.<br><br>Maresca, who received vocal support from Cole Palmer following the victory over PSG in New York, has been focusing on addressing his team's inconsistencies. He aims to prepare them both tactically and mentally to compete with top clubs like Liverpool, Arsenal, and Manchester City for the Premier League title, not just in cup competitions, reports the Mirror.<br><br>And Shearer, the former England skipper, has praised Maresca's efforts and believes Chelsea are poised for a title challenge. "I think it would take a very, very brave person to say that Chelsea would not be involved in the title hunt next year because of what they’ve achieved this season, what they’ve just achieved [winning the Club World Cup], who they’ve signed, who they will sign," Shearer said on the latest episode of The Rest Is Football.<br><br>"I think you have to say that they will be involved in the title race." Speaking about Maresca and the Club World Cup final, Shearer added: "It was a masterclass from Maresca because PSG went in, their football has worked all season and why not? Why should they change anything?<br><br>"But I think the little tweaks from Maresca, they’re pressing high and all those things, and I just think it worked perfectly for them and he deserves huge credit, not only for the job he’s done in this competition, but for the whole season.<br><br>"I don’t think anyone knew what to expect because you know what happens at Chelsea, it’s happened before: if you don’t win things, you know exactly what happens. You’re in there for a reason and know how it’s going to work. He’s done a magnificent job, he really has."<br><br>Nicolas Jackson, however, has been linked with an exit from Stamford Bridge following the impressive starts of Depal and Pedro since joining the club. Aston Villa are one of a number of clubs keeping tabs on the striker.<br><br>Asked about Jackson, Shearer said: "As soon as [Joao] Pedro came in and scored the two goals and Delap's already there, if there's one person that's going to be shifted out then my guess it would be Jackson. It wouldn't surprise me if they've already offered him to other football clubs and they've enquired about it."<br><br>Want to keep up to date with the breaking and important Chelsea stories whilst on the move?
