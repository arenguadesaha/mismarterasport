I've played at full-back, as a reserve goalkeeper but we're back on track now.<br><br>"People are fit, they're back from injuries and we're creating that snowball effect."<br><br>Taylor was impressed by her versatility, but Stanway knew where she wanted to play.<br><br>The crisis passed, but in May 2022, the midfielder signed a three-year deal with German giants Bayern Munich.<br><br>On top of the world with England<br><br>However, she did not let the move impact her performances with England.<br><br>Due to a lack of playing time at Manchester City and fierce competition for places in the Lionesses midfield, Stanway had to fight for minutes when Sarina Wiegman first took the job.<br><br>Stanway added: "It's unbelievable, previously under Sarina it's been challenging for me and that's been partly down to me playing at full-back for my club so I haven't been able to show what I'm capable of doing.<br><br>"It's been good to get the minutes at Manchester City but no matter what, I'll always put up a fight to try to get on that pitch.<br><br>"I'll fight for the girls, I'll put my body on the line and I'll have that mentality no matter what.<br><br>After forcing her way into the Dutch coach's squad for the Women's Euros in 2022, she showed the country what she is capable of.<br><br>After her penalty kick-started the 8-0 rout of Norway in the group stage, her outrageous strike in extra-time made all the difference as England beat Spain 2-1 to reach the semi-finals of the tournament,<br><br>Stanway then played 89 minutes at Wembley as the Lionesses made history in the final against Germany.<br><br>And she got the chance to celebrate the victory in the best way possible, by serenading her new Bayern team-mates with a rousing rendition of Sweet Caroline.<br><br>Alongside Walsh, Stanway continued to be first choice in the Lionesses’ midfield for the 2023 Women’s World Cup, with their matches taking place in Australia.<br><br>She scored their first goal of the tournament with a penalty which turned out to be the winner against Haiti, although thankfully a miss from the spot was not costly in their shoot-out victory over Nigeria in the last 16.<br><br>England went on to reach their first ever World Cup final – and the country’s first at senior level for 57 years – but this time Stanway and her team-mates would have to accept the runners-up medals.<br><br>The Lionesses struggled to get a grip in the middle of the park against an impressive Spain side that ran out 1-0 winners in Sydney.<br><br>After a mixed start to life in Germany, Stanway took to life in the Frauen-Bundesliga and has helped Bayern Munich land the league title in each of her three seasons with them.<br><br>However, she was forced to miss much of the 2024/25 campaign with a lateral collateral knee ligament injury picked up in January that required surgery.<br><br>She has picked up an interest in tattooing since her move to Bayern and has even had some of her team-mates under the needle.<br><br>Stanway, whose younger brother Wyll is a goalkeeper at hometown club Barrow, told FourFourTwo: “One day I walked into a studio in Munich and ended up becoming friends with the owner and one of the tattoo artists.<br><br>“We just had a thing of, ‘OK, I’ll learn how to do it and hopefully one day we can tattoo each other’, just as a sign of our friendship.<br><br>"But I ended up really enjoying it and wanting to do more. I enjoy the fact I can give someone something that will stay with them forever, and that they place that trust in me."<br><br>Thankfully for the Lionesses, they will be able to place their trust again in Stanway on the pitch after she made her comeback from injury in their Women’s Nations League matches against Portugal and Spain in June.<br><br>She showed she still has an eye for goal by smashing in an excellent strike against Jamaica in their final warm-up with what was her 22nd goal for her country in her 78th cap.<br><br>Stanway gave England one of their iconic moments during the 2022 Women’s Euros – will she do likewise during the defence of their title in Switzerland?<br><br>The July 2025 edition of Women's Football News is available now.
